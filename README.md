# YouTube Product Review Sentiment Analyzer

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Our project analyzes comment sentiment on Youtube product review videos. To achieve this, we fine-tuned a pre-trained **BERT** model (`"bert-base-uncased"`) with 1,185 manually labeled entries. 

To download our fine-tuned model, click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P52GL9VLMxN9SAsMYR7SdOkV9b7TUQ4N/view?usp=sharing). 

We also built a user-friendly web interface, developed with Streamlit, enabling users to input a video URL to receive a summarized sentiment analysis for both the product and the video.

This work represents our final course project for **ISE 540 (Text Analytics)**, completed by ***Zijin Qin***, ***Aria Xu***, ***Abhijeet Nijjar***, and ***Junhao Liang***.

## ðŸš€ How to Deploy Application/Project

### Clone the Project Files

Select a local directory and clone this project: 

```
git init
git clone https://github.com/Jziumo/ISE-540-Final-Project.git
```

Create a new virtual environment venv in current directory. (It's recommended to use python 3.10 to avoid version incompatibility.)

```
python -m venv ./venv/
```

Activate the virtual environment. If you are using **Windows**, run this: 

```
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If you are using **Linux**, run this: 

```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Then you should see `(venv)` on the left side of your command line. (Not `(base)`!)

### Download the Model Files

To download our fine-tuned model, click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P52GL9VLMxN9SAsMYR7SdOkV9b7TUQ4N/view?usp=sharing). 

Then, unzip and put the files in the root directory of the project like this: 

```
your_project_root/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sentiment_for_product_stable/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sentiment_for_video_stable/  
```

### Obtain Key for Youtube Data API

Since currently we are using **Youtube Data API v3** to obtain video comments, the application needs a key for the API to work.

Obtain a key for Youtube Data API following: 
- Go to [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- Search `YouTube Data API v3`
- Choose **'Public API'** to obtain a key

Put your key in `config.toml` like this: 

```
[api_keys]
youtube = "YOUR KEY"
```

### Deploy the Web Application

Install the libraries used in these scripts. 

```
pip install -r requirements_app.txt
```

Then start the web application by running: 

```
start
```

If it doesn't work, just directly run `main.py`:

```
python -m src.main
``` 

### Train the Model

If you want to train the model on your own data, install these libraries: 

```
pip install -r requirements_train.txt
```

Make sure your CUDA environment is compatible with CUDA 12.1. 

Then modify and run `model.py`. The model files will be saved in `./models`: 

```
your_project_root/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sentiment_for_product_current/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sentiment_for_video_current/  
```
