This vs lebron 21	1	1
Glad Nike got this right	2	2
I love the look of these, and the fact that they're not as narrow as the GT Cut 2. But that price.....$190 for these.....Seriously? Oh well, they just might be worth the money, we'll see. Thanks for another dope video from Weartesters!	2	2
"Me after these arrive: ""Damnit, Nightwing, look what you made me do!"" 🤣"	1	1
Your description sounds like ( and it Looks like) a copy of the Shockwave 5, but I'll give the my a try.  FYI though, Nike outsoles wear out way faster on outdoor courts..	1	1
Hey Man,  where did u get that”Kind Words Cost Nothing”  hoodie ur wearing in this video brother ? 😍 🔥	2	2
Hey WearTesters! Here's a new idea on how to keep this channel up and running and gain more subscribers: Start making videos on revisiting sneakers you've reviewed in the past or recently. I mean, another performance review after they've been used several times. It's for viewers to learn how basketball shoes perform in the long term or after they've been used many times! Not just SINGLE reviews after you tested them for a few games only or first time on-feet feeling. Basketball shoes perform differently after many uses.	1	2
i really like basketball shoes that look and feel like running shoes like this series . for my style of play is ideal.when i seldom play outdoors for fun with kids wearing my running shoes is always more comfort and free but lacks of support and cushion.that gap is filled with the built of this bballshoe .if only this upper close to the toes area wasn't kind of square shape .it should have been one piece connected with the rest upper.very good design! not the price though! only on bargain to buy.these recycled synthetic materials are all crap to pay for 190 ! thanks for the presentation!	2	2
These were going to be on my wish list. Its been since the T mac Millennium since I copped anything for the court but another torn ACL retired me. I might still try to pick them up if they ever hit discount. But I'm sad I wouldn't be able to put these to their intended purpose	2	1
should put zoom stroble on gt-cut 3	1	1
The sole is similar to the material used on Lebron 17’s. Picks up dust easily and need to be wiped every possession to have a proper grip. The sole is very grippy specially on clean squeaky courts.	2	2
"Can't wait to get them on court- the CUt 2 was an aterthought (and w/ the ankle slippage of that shoe demmed super dangerous), the cut 3 really has lot of potential. We shall see "" if you don't wipe your shoes, are. youreally a basketball player"" really got me.. LOL"	2	2
Def improvement over the 2, but at that price is it better then WOW all city 2	2	2
I’ve been waiting on this review. Almost bought them on ID4shoes then I was like nah Nightwing hasn’t done the review yet. Lol	2	2
I love the first GT Cut amazing and beautiful shoe but this one is kind of weird or ugly	0	0
Those look sexy fr. Think they’ll have the same bounce sensation as the Jordan XXV low just softer. Judging from my Invincible run 3’s , that zoom X cannot be tamed even if you cage it in it’s hella bouncy and soft 👍🏿	2	2
Is the EP version wider?	1	1
got mine today at outlet for $69. when i tried it on, whoooaahhh such a good feeling. im just a weekend warrior. so i really need a very good cushion shoes	2	2
Is the shoe mainly for indoor courts or can it be used for outdoor courts?	1	2
What are your thoughts on putting in the move insoles?	1	1
Are these the EP version? That might explain the wider last?	1	1
Fission 9 review when?	1	1
killed this. great job.	2	2
Love the message on the hoodie! I’ve been meaning to grab a GT Cut. Are these breathable? Will you do a comparison videos between these and the take down version?	1	2
"just got my pair from a retailer today, it's very interesting how my first reaction was also "" damn these are fun"". The traction feels awesome, the rubber feels really sticky, and the heel to toe transition is impeccable, very smooth. However, I would say the court feel isn't that great comparing to the ja 1s, Kyrie's, and kobe's, cuz it feels a little high off ground. The cushioning feels new to me, it doesn't have the compressive feeling of a zoom unit, but rather feels soft. There's a visible grey pebax plate (or whatever it's called) under the rubber, and it allows you to have a quick explosive comeback when you do stuff like the rocker step. Overall, very interesting shoes! (ps. in my opinion, if you are buying the ep versions, you should go down half a size)"	2	2
I want to add these to  my rotation of basketball rotation these, Lebron 20, Kobe 4, and Serious Player only	2	2
looks and seems with nice features, but only zoomX over air zoom is a no go  :(	1	1
I played in the GT Cut 3s for 6+ hours now and they attract a lot of dust. Playing basketball is super annoying if you have to wipe after every other play. Maybe solid rubber will be better? Idk has anyone had the same experience? Do they get better? Thinking about returning them already lol	0	1
Any frame do we see the inner side of the shoe?	1	1
i'm in the market for a running shoe..last one i had was a the lunar back in 2018...what's the follow up to that shoe?	1	1
They look like Lebrons 21	1	1
They definitely look nice	2	2
These give me the same feeling as the original crazylight boosts back in 2016- the cushioning compared to other hoop shoes is next level. Haven't been this excited about the introduction of new tech in a hoop shoe since then, and have not been disappointed!	1	1
Chinese brand like Li-Ning & Anta already great at making basketball shoes with Supercritical midsole with carbon fiber plate, Nike is kinda late to do this	2	2
We don't wipe soles in PR. we just play in any court.	1	1
At least where I play here in Brazil,we don't usually wipe the traction and it's very rare to see someone doing it too. And it's outdoors!	1	1
I got the miami vibes color way, the fit feels great, traction hands down.	2	2
Those are fire 🔥	1	1
Looking like a LeBron @ first glance	2	2
Seeing mixed initial impressions! Any date on US release?	1	1
Of all the reviews you were the first one to praise the ZoomX. Gives me hope.	2	2
I’ve been saying this ever since I saw this. The shape of the midsole really reminds of me the Jordan Jumpman Hustle.	2	2
Reminds me of the old Alpha Project, the line that kinda pioneered the way for the Hyperfuse line or something. The kicks that had the transparent heel counter. They came out around the time of the Ultraposites, Flightposite 3s, Hyperdunks and VCs Shox. I think Gary Payton wore them in LA	1	1
I bought these for my son but bummed they don’t have a shank. They fold in half so I’m not sure they will have much energy return.	1	1
@Weartesters do these feel high off the ground? or feel like there could be stability issues? I only ask because the heel looks high off the ground compared to the forefoot. thanks	2	2
why did those leak photos of a different shoe came out like a month ago..? they came out as GTcut 3s..	1	1
How would you compare this to any of the Kobe line? I’ve been chasing the Kobe 5-6 feeling.	1	1
Actually look good 🎉	2	2
"Imagine ZoomX with Zoom Air in GT Cut 4.

MIND BLOWNNN"	1	1
The 2s look better to me	1	1
My son has both GT Cut 3 and Academy.  He loves the Academy and is a great value but the GT Cuts 3 are in another level with comfort, cushioning and energy return.	2	2
My comment would be, can they make 3/4 or high top versions like back in the day.	2	2
I agree that this should have been the successor to the first one appearance wise. The GT Cut 2 looks like it's from a branched timeline. 😂	2	2
Those are the same design as the sabrina one	1	1
I was just hoping that they don’t cage the zoom X foam because that’s the most comfortable Nike Foam	2	2
Looks like it is a winner for sure!	2	2
I wish the insole was just a full length piece of Zoom Air 🫠 I’m excited to try these, been wanting ZoomX in non runners ever since owning the OG Invincible Run	2	2
Changed mine with red laces, made it look like kobe grinch a bit😁	1	1
Hello, I have a question about GT CUT 3. The models in the video are clear-outsole models, and there is a model called CNY as a commemorative of the Year of the Snake, which is a rubber outsole model with opaque outsole. Is there a big difference between that model and the regular model? I can't find a review of opaque models like CNY. 😭 Please help me, everyone	1	1
Bro, they don’t even look like a basketball shoe they look like a running shoe😂😂	1	1
this should be on Nike By You. Imagine the colorways you can create	2	2
Man, that colourway reminds me of the Zoom Flight 2K3 Varsity Red	1	1
Thanks as always for the review! I’m looking forward to seeing more colorways / loving ZoomX these days!!	2	2
Can't wait for GT Jump 3.	1	1
ja 1 or gt cut 3 (which one better for their price?)	2	2
Oooooh!!! Good to hear that they did this right…unlike the React launch with the superfly. I remember that nonsense. LOL. Really excited to see the performance review…..those look so dope! It kinda takes me back to early 2000 nike basketball where they were putting out crazy performance bangers!	2	2
Maybe he already talked about it in another video (maybe he wants his privacy), but what’s up with Mr. Wing’s hip? I’ve been missing his performance review videos for a while, but he can’t hoop anymore at all? Just wishing him good health (as a fellow aging hooper)	1	2
Hey Chris, just wanted to ask are you not able to play any at all anymore?	1	1
These for some reason give me Iverson vibes. I dig’em!	1	1
Are these wide foot friendly?!!	2	2
Has any one tried wearing with a brace? Should I go half a size up	0	0
Stoked to c a new gt cut. Great review, informative as always	2	2
They were the Ultraflights. Thats what these kinda remind me of. The Zoom Ultraflights	1	1
So fast dude, you earned my sub today.	2	2
Being from overseas, they come with XDR?	1	1
Atleast they ditched the drop in. Maybe next year they will put real zoom in em.	1	1
These look great 😊	2	2
They were the Ultraflights. Thats what these kinda remind me of. The Zoom Ultraflights	1	1
Loved the GT Cut 2s, they were my favorite hoop shoe of the past season. I've been saying the 3s are gonna be the best hoop shoes of this season so I'm very hyped	2	2
"Hey Chris, where did you cop the ""Kind Words Cost Nothing"" hoodie from?
Love from Australia!"	2	2
just finished painting a fence for 3 hours now im watching this masterpiece.. ill come back to this in 3 years🙌🏽	2	2
Damn Zion caught a stray haha	2	2
Definitely a nice looking shoe. I hope the colorways are on point.	2	2
I think they’re 🔥 $190 is too much tho	2	2
I love you Christ❤, but I’m a real hooper and I didn’t wipe my sole 😂 next time I will do it thanks man	2	2
🤪air you a Hooper?..... Love it!!!!!	2	2
Why does that shoe has the Sabrina 1 frame? I was doing some Nike ID and k could swear it's the same shoe	1	1
Immma need that green pair!!! Headed to ID4 shoes in 3 2 1...😂	2	2
Pls review the gt cut 3 zoom 5 edition the jason kidd version. 🙏🏼	1	1
these look great but if these don’t have some zoom air in the forefoot i might have to pass because between zoom in the fore foot and heel in the basketball models and the zoom infront zoomx everywhere in thier runners (the best set up imo) it’s just the best they offer. zoom air>>	1	2
I loved the Gt Cut .1 was lucky to get 2 pairs  .2 was a let dwn IMO. Im loving the .3 tho cnt wait 4 otha colorways	2	2
Are these good for wide-footed guy like me?	1	2
Of course it’s not, and all the people driving it have a lease payment to make.	1	1
Rory love your content...is it possible I'm American...can you do USD???	2	2
This is as really helpful, I fell into the trap of thinking all electric cars are filling up for the price of a Mars bar. £60 of fuel in my Astra ecoflex gets me 600 miles! 😂	2	2
A truly stunning car. Wish they did a petrol version. fix your gutter Rory 🤣	2	2
I have one, you don't get anywhere above 180m in range. Keep the car for longer and the screens will start to freeze, sensors will stop working	0	0
So you are going on and on about build quality because a 120k car hasnt fallen off in 6000 miles?	1	1
"Rory,
How can you have had the car for 6 months and not had to top up the washer fluid once ? 
Seriously wondering 🤔"	1	1
Rory. Great long term review. £120,000 Insane! Just not for everyone...any one? Certainly better than the jelly mould Porsche it is based on. As for the Tesla.... not in the same league. Just buy a 208e and bank the rest for a rainy day.	0	2
Model S won't do anything like 370 miles - except perhaps for the one shot into space... A good way to tell if Tesla is lying is if Elon's lips are moving	2	2
I'm being a troll.....but surely the best place for a phone is actually hidden away?? Where would you want it in easy reach..	2	2
Is that Bedford? Looks like you were on the Embankment, also the A421 past Abbeyfields, and the B645 (great driving road) round to the B660? I used to live around there years ago.	1	2
Depreciation is ridiculous!! So no thank you	0	0
"The reason I don't buy the car is because it's too low. My knees don't allow me to get into cars that close to the street anymore.
So I have to stick to my fat E-tron. 😊"	0	1
Thanks God is no depreciation guy on comment section	2	2
Look at the 2nd hand values and the question is easily answered.	2	2
Haven't driven this car but I do like Audis. I've only driven Tesla and BMW ev and didn't like them.	2	2
Design is amazing	2	2
"Guys had the car for 6 months from brand new and is talking about build quality, drive it 5-10 years and then tell me if its not rattling and loose feeling.

Everything feels solid when its new

I sell cars for a living, and i sell loads of 1-2 year old cars that look brand new.

Its not that impressive"	1	1
I know this ain't the point but that's an iPhone 14 Pro Max	1	1
"If I had to rank the EVs by looks it would go:
1. Audi E-Tron GT
2. Porsche Taycan
3. BMW I-series
4. Tesla Model S3XY Performance/Plaids
5. Mercedes EVs"	2	2
How on earth is this car £120k???? Pricing of cars is just ridiculous. And certain brands are just over charging.	0	1
"GT is short for Grand Touring 
And it fails at that ?"	0	0
Four hours if the upper limit that most people want to do? That’s cute 🇨🇦	2	2

Great review as per usual! I really like that you took the effort to do a long-term review. Keep up the phenomenal work, and some of the best presentation out there Rory🙌	2	2
"Battery cars will NOT last.
I give it 10 years.

A fleat of old classics.

MITSUBISHI GT3000.
Nissan 300zx.
Datsun 280z.
I could go on...."	0	0
Value should be at  65 to 70k	1	1
More of these long-term vids please! Enjoyed it. Good job you	2	2
I love the exterior style and design of this Audi e-Tron! For my Tesla Model S, it was touch-free on the outside. I could open AND close the boot or the bonnet by using the fob. It was great! I now have a 2025 Porsche Taycan which is way behind Tesla. The Taycan bonnet is like you said; you can use a hand gesture to pop the hood but it doesn't actually open all the way as Tesla's does. Porsche's boot also opens and closes all the way with a foot gesture, but you have to move your foot very slowly for it to work.	2	2
“This… is a lawnmower.”	1	1
I bet it's not £120k now!	1	1
I will stick to the S7, thanks <3	2	2
Worthless couldn’t give mine away	0	0
"Can’t believe you’re giving it such plaudits for NOT falling apart within 6 months?! Is that really an accomplishment? Especially for something so damn expensive?

My 6 year old Ford Focus is still in faultless condition but even after 6 years I would class that as impressive - cars SHOULD last 10-20 years now, as a bare minimum"	2	2
Not worth it	0	0
they look good, too good for an EV	2	2
It's an Audi. All the German cars, except Opel/Vauxhall, all the Japanese cars and American big-ass SUVs and pick-up trucks are the best.	2	2
Nice driving shots from Bedford 🙂	2	2
"When you are talking about a car and a price of 100.000 and higher there is no worth involved.
It's not worth.
Such cars are just showoff luxury items for the snobs to brag about their financial prowess.
These cars have a stupid high profit margin, aka buyers are being scammed as the value per dollar/euro/pound/whatever currency spent is very low.
Even a 50.000 car falls into that category, unless it has some new tech involved. (For example tesla model 3/y)
That is where you ask yourself is it worth to buy a model 3 or a something else.
What do i get for that money? And if you use the various incentives from governments to bring the sales price down (tax credit is not it) how much benefits per dollar spent do i get.?"	1	1
I see you're driving around Bedford!	1	1
Trying to increase resale value?? I respect your game 😂	0	0
Course it’s not worth it, do you know of an electric vehicle that is not overpriced?	0	0
Now that is a cool EV, not the stupidly tall Teslas everyone is buying these days. Love the red leather interior 👍🏻	2	2
Can't get over the wonky tail lights, front end bumper from the new Honda Accord or Civic.. Taycan is a much better cohesive design overall. For 60k used may be worth it.	1	2
"They aren’t worth the MSRP - the open market has determined this. This is one of the few cars with HUGE manufacturer discounts - because 1 year old cars are worth approximately 50% of the new list price!! No joke. I watch the wholesale market data. 

Just watched a 2022 sell for $95k CAD with a new MSRP over $200k!!!"	1	1
"2:05 The second gripe doesn't make any sense at all, in fact it's a good thing.
If the phone is connected to the car you don't need it while driving"	2	2
It's much less likely to be stolen when requires changing	1	1
You're the Idris Elba of car presenters. Charisma, voice and competence all 100%.	2	2
It actually makes sense to put your phone out of sight, as you’ll not be tempted to use it while driving. I like that.	1	1
"£120,000? Seriously? 😂🤣
Waste of money for a car that will need its battery replaced in five years. 
Audi are so out of touch 😂🤣"	0	0
My god, £60 to fill the battery for up to 218 miles. That'd be £25 for my Dacia Sandero diesel. For £60 of diesel I could get just over 500 miles! Madness.	1	1
Buddy, you have an iphone 14 pro max not 14 plus ! !	1	1
7:25 really love your reviewes - because you always mention the right things, but your pronounciation of PORSCHEEEEEE, by saying PORSCHAAAAAAAAA is just......	2	2
Its sure looks good. I saw one in a cherry red colour. If i weren't at work at the time, i'd have lingered a while longer to admire it.	2	2
"“That’s aside” referring to vehicles short range 😂😂😂 What is the purpose of a GT if you need to drive at 60mph to do 280 miles?
You need 5 hours to do 280 miles!!!!
Even Yugo can do better!
That’s a town car mate, not a GT!!!"	0	2
No thanks.	0	1
My 2022 Etron GT with 1600 miles on it has been sitting in the dealership for over 90 days due to software/computer problems.  Took the car in for software updates and the even in spite of a new computer control module being flown in from Germany and installed; the Audi regional engineers are still trying to diagnose the problem and make repairs.   To date, there has been no contact from Audi and very little information from the dealership; there has been no promise as to when the car will be drivable again.  This was my first Audi and my last Audi......In addition, would not recommend the Etron GT, especially since the car can loose over 40% of its value in the first year.	0	1
You are pulling the door handle too much. The first half is the electric opening and the last half is the mecanical opening (for emergensy use).	1	1
If you have one of these Audi's, I dare say you employ a greenskeeper. No need to.cart a lawnmower.	1	1
You have some dead pixels on one of your cameras, my heart stopped for a moment thinking my OLED broke… ;)	1	1
Of course it’s not worth it. You’re buying 4 fancy rings and the imagined ego boost. Many of these so-called luxury EVs don’t even feature particularly clever design or have efficient motors.	0	2
9:50 PPF is the way to go with these piano black interiors! 👌 keeps it in mint condition!	0	0
So your conclusion is DON'T BUY ELECTRIC CARS	0	0
Man like Rors! God damn that's a good car review :)	2	2
Awesome long-term review Rory. I think the reason the screens haven't frozen is because Audi stuck with the tried and tested, no fancy, new fangled stuff	2	2

I am so confused, he said the tech isn't great but what tech do you want? I feel like people are always like oh the tech is good or bad but what does that even mean? What are people even talking about? Nobody ever even says what they mean, its like a trigger word like 'sustainability' like it means something but it doesn't. I had a Tesla and an etron GT and I can tell you that the etron GT was MONUMENTALLY nicer than the Tesla. I guess the etron doesn't have pointless games and a fart noise maker though...? Is that what people mean by tech? The only positive to Tesla is range I didn't need and the charging network.	1	1
Great review, seems a very versatile car	2	2
It looks like a very low tech basic EV, maybe 40k is a reasonable price. I don't believe Germans can sell EVs, they are just too nostalgic and extremely overpriced! They will fade away, watch their EV sales numbers	1	1
thanks bro, pretty timely and informative, the length of time sitting waiting on recharge however . . . i dunno	2	2
No way is it worth £120k. The price of new cars is completely out of control now & after the autumn budget it looks like Dacia will sell a lot of cars. Anyway look at the second hand values of any Audi hybrid or electric cars. Dropping like stones.	2	2
You are the best reviewer on YouTube, so well done. I got an E-Tron, and I can't get more than 200 miles from a full charge, but it not very often I need more in a signal journey. but it is a great car and so comfortable. I love to have a GT but not in my price range	2	2
"Does it have a ""*"" button on a steering wheel? My A4 has it and you can choose a function for that key by yourself. I am using it for drive select."	1	1
Hell no not worth it. You can get a used r8 for half the price. And not deal with the extra pain in the ass an electric car becomes when it needs repaired.  Why pay more for a more expensive to fix car that performes the exact same as an r 8 that costs twice as much? Lol. Its def a hard pass for me. F that	0	0
I actually like Audi not going full on into developing an entire infotainment system. No matter what car you produce it's always the case that by the end of the production, the system and the apps on it are already outdated. Android and iOS apps are moving at lightspeed and there is no point of racing against them. Simple Android Auto and Apple Carplay is more than enough. They are basically offering you wireless displays to which you can connect your phone to your car. It can't get any more personalized than that.	2	2
Short answer: Yes.	2	2
If you can afford one you can afford fuel so go buy an rs7 you have no compromises	1	1
"Love the review sir!

Have owned a 22 Prem (just below RS) for 22k miles from new.   It’s my daily driver.  I’m 6’5” and all legs, but find it comfortable.  Getting in-out of such a low car can be tricky. 

The car is solid, but it has had some major recalls and failures (heater recall, brakes repairs {no recall}.  There is no over-the -air software update I think to support the dealership model. That force us back to dealership for software which is crazy, but I get it. 

This review some what matches my is real life experiences.  It frank and honest,but  I think he nip-pic on stuff that just doesn’t matter.  

*Never had issue with door handle pitching me, I agree not good if it happens. 
*True there is no good spot to put phone.  I put my IP+ on the floor or on passenger seat.  
* the phone charger in the compartment is crappy. Over heats like other car due to lack of ventilation. IP+ in case is too large and not worth hassle. I use a cable plugged into back seat. 
*  tires are pricey but you can find reasonable options. *deprecation/loss of value hit is real and bad. Cost of doing business to a degree.  I wished I had leased, water up the bridge at this point. *range is better than Audi advertise which is better than not getting what was advertised. * tech is basic, but not horrible. The MMI system could use some improvements. You have to repeatedly reset or acknowledge app updates.  

I love the car, but she ain’t perfect.  Would still take it over any Telsa model.  

I would still chose GT over Taycan because of external  profile and internal layout (lack of buttons)."	1	1

honestly, I do not think it's so bad. If they would pair it with smartphones, it would be a great product.	2	1
"It's mentioned a few times that it's ""a little AI in a box""... Until the AI can run fully locally this device won't really go anywhere. Very good review, I enjoyed every minute of it and found it very balanced."	0	2
If it wasn't for the laser display, I would have felt like this device was made for people with poor eyesight.	2	1
I will never buy tech that is worn on or around my heart unless it’s a pace maker. No sir!	0	1
Great review. Gah this seems like such a good idea on paper…??	2	2
Honestly, it's criminal how they charge you $100 more for a color change	0	1
Tired of having a screen in your hand? Well now your hand *is* the screen!	1	1
Its not the worst product you have reviewed, take another guess.....	0	1
It makes next to no sense that it isn't a voice input/software solution for a language model running on your phone...	0	1
Even if this product gets popular, noone with a pacemaker may be able to use it.	0	1
Maybe useful for blind people	2	1
I actually like this idea. Its a step towards the right direction.	2	1
If it can link with smart phone.....it can be a better thing....	2	1
For the scan and voice command? I think this is absolutely good assistant to the blind ????	2	1
This shit would’ve been dope in the 80’s	1	1
This is a 'phone' for blind people, with 1000ping.	0	1
Pin: And a red carpet on the floor Marques: … great …	1	1
So basically, it does everything way worse than a $300 dollar phone while asking for a subscription on top of it?	0	1
I think apple or samsung can come up with a similar better version of it	2	1
"bro, why did you type ""lens""? just touch on the icon next to the mic icon in the search bar"	1	1
0:18 Bro really said wearable glasses…like bro…That’s the point of glasses xD	1	1
Smart glasses, smart wireless earbuds like the bragi dash or smart contact lenses... would be so much more powerful than this could ever be.	0	1
So they just made a cute gadget that can connect with AI feed channels and customizations... Might as well just use your phone or a smartwatch!	0	1
I invested in a kickstarted project that was a bracelet that did this, of course the Russian duo showed pictures of dev and it was all fake graphics on the campaign, it never came to fruition.	1	1
The irony of this video rn ?? 50$ for wallpapers lol	1	1
I can just see apple buying this company and perfecting this technology. The iPin hehe	2	1
I saw its potentials in the future. I think it could be great for the elderly who suffer memory loss , and for the emergency calls...	2	1
Perfect review. You stated your opinions and then gave more than enough product information so that viewers can make their own well informed decisions.	1	2
Never buy a product based on future promises is a phrase I keep hearing more and more often in review videos...	0	1
People getting mad are the same ones that want AI to legit takeover	1	1
Apple doesn’t have anything new mostly just same specs and late compared to samsung..still you dont go hard at those products..why here???	1	1
gotta love the projector Fallout green color	1	1
Not even 2 minutes yet. Knowing the price and subscription nonsense, I want to see the company goes bankrupt.	0	1
the best possible use is for a blind/vision impared person. Especially the describe to me what you see ability.	2	1
Great review. This tech has potential. Improve the features and reduce the price and I will purchase.	2	2
Truth is Truth	1	1
Not worried about the heat, but all that usability friction is gonna start a fire.	0	1
These AI standalone devices would have been a hit 10 years ago when Siri and Alexa were starting to get big...	0	1
Until we are able to stuff the whole ai servers into a box like this... make it easier than googling the stuff... This is useless.	0	1
What I don't understand about these ai assistants is who are they for? Whose life is so busy they need an ai assistant?	1	1
They lost me at the $24 monthly subscription ??	0	1
This wallpaper dude is insulting hardware products.	1	1
Battery and charging above your heart is really a no-go just saying	0	1
This is a great device as a PROTOTYPE, not as an easily integrated consumer device for everyone. It is literally just a much worse phone	0	1
I think you’re a bit cruel in your review. I see nothing but good things ahead for this product.	2	1
So a small phone??	1	1
it's not that bad actually, especially for a first iteration product	2	1
The people trying to justify this product are actually delusional	0	1
"I understand the ""reminding"" feature but thats what ""Hey Siri"" or ""Hey Google"" is for... so yea"	0	1
i think is a good idea for someone blind to use	2	1
I respect Marques in his extreme fairness and unbiasedness, but really? You tried to give this a +1...	0	1
From the online hate i thought you SLANDERED the product and its creators. SAVAGELY  slayed them. Then i watch this and im like, youre more moderate and kind than most	1	2
who ok'd this and thought that's a seller?	0	1
Gimmicky little item for lazy people	0	1
This may be helpful for blind people but the cost is really high	2	1
This is only good as a side product for the main device such a cell phone ??	2	1
when i look into this product, it could be the beginning of the technology like Focus in Horizon Zero Dawn game... but too bad, this is just corporate greed imo.	0	1
I could see this being a good disability play - telling a blind person what they can see is pretty cool	2	1
This is good review. No wonder board watched it??	1	2
I wonder how useful this device would be for the blind community. Asking it what it sees when you dont have anyone around you to ask seems pretty helpful.	2	1
What a nice review. Subscribed!	1	2
Everytime you want to take your sweater/jacket off/on, you have to detach this thing and re-attach. Which can be all the time depending on the weather and what you're doing.	0	1
You are wearing it close to your heart. Is it absolutely safe or what?	0	1
So it costs 3,580$ if you want to actually use it for at least ten years. I hate having to pay additional fees... Greedy business model.	0	1
Good Concept for blind people and or people with vision problem.	2	1
Oppo Find X8 Pro should have been the phone of 2025 so far	1	1

Yeah Oneplus 13 Great Camera glad i bought it	2	2
And fun fact. The becoming Huawei Pura 80 Ultra have 4 cameras. 2 of them is an EQUAL price of Oneplus 13r	1	1
Im having trouble with certain phone because of their back being glass (which makes phone cooler obsolete)	1	1
Pretty sure the x200 ultra outclasses the one plus when it comes to the camera. Cant argue its not an all round better phone since ive mever used the one plus but ive seen plenty of camera tests.	1	1
Waiting for Redmagic YT to drop a comment	1	1
Ha! Production value, you Chris are all the value that is needed here  and good list, well done.	2	2
I agree so much with his views, no one needs anything more than the mid range and I hate apple.	1	1
Sooo sooo proud to be a oneplus 13 user i agreed 100000% because this phone is something to me itzz just mind blowing😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥 that smoothness and using experience 😍😍😍😍 i loved it so much🔥🔥🔥	2	2
I don't have enough money for the OnePlus 13, but I do have enough for the OnePlus 13r. Should I go for it, unc?	1	1
I love cmf phone 2 if it has at least Snapdragon 855	2	2

speed dials your mum is the best take on the extra button	2	2
"Proudly watching on my amazing Oneplus 13.

 Yeah, I'm too smug about it"	2	2
Planning to buy the nothing phone 3a pro after I lost my 2a in a lake. I originally wanted the 3a but it doesn't have esim and the pro is only like 40 eur more so i'll be getting the pro. Thanks for dropping this video right when I was deciding on my new phone, it really helped solidify my choice.	2	2
Just returned my Pixel 8a - genuinely the worst phone I've ever owned - going to replace it with the CMF Phone 2	0	0
And that's why I heard your advice and got a OnePlus 13 when it came out	1	1
Ridiculous to think one plus is the best camera..... nah	2	2
Foul mouthed and slightly drunk	1	1
OP 13 is the best surely.	2	2
Samsung s25 should be in best smartphone list	2	2
I agree entirely with your awards. I have personally used Pixel 9 Pro XL, Galaxy S25 Ultra, iPhone 16 Pro Max, and OnePlus 13, and I always come back to the OnePlus 13. It is alaround the best for sure. I can say Pixel has the best photo, in my opinion, but OnePlus just does everything excellently.	2	2
@TechSpurt Brooooo 😭 how can I get those anime wallpapers of yours....🙏🙏🙏	1	1
Kids just buy iPhones.	1	1
Loving my OP13🇷🇺❤️🇨🇳	1	1
Why is the oneplus 13 not available in UK stores on a contract as I really want one 😫	1	1
12:06 just bought the OnePlus 13 waiting for it to arrive going to let my Poco F2 pro rest...	1	1
for anyone into the budget category, POCO F7 is an absolute beast launching tomorrow.	1	1
One plus 13 best camera??wtf uncle???nah 😂😂 never	2	2
Where the Poco love? X7 Pro is best pound for pound phone available.	2	2
I'm looking to upgrade my Oneplus 7T after over 5.5 years should I wait for nothing phone 3 or just buy OP 13. and is there any better option around that budget? Love the video BTW	2	2
OnePlus 13 is the best Android phone that offers smooth UI and performance.	2	2
Great top choice Chris, I just acquired an oppo x8 pro astonishing in every department. Esperanza the cameras, I'd put this in the mix but it may have been late 24. Love and hugs to you and Mr wanksock ❤	2	2
Best compact phone of the year next time!!	2	2
What about Pixel 9a? Can be a competitive option?	1	1
how would i get the vivo x200 pro or ultra in the UK?	1	1
Bro i need a phone ❤ please give me	1	1
Oneplus doesn't even come close to the rest...	1	1
OnePlus 13 is KING	1	1
For me, I went for Poco f7 Ultra after watching your review. It's a bit cheaper in my country and also comes with Dolby Atmos support which the OP13 lacks. The cameras are also super good ( not flagship level for sure but they still quite good ) . Thanks uncle ! Keep up the good work	2	2
What about gt 30 pro and poco x7 pro and poco f7 in the budget and mid range part?	1	1
What, in your opinion, would have the best battery life? Need a phone that can last days (sometimes a week) without charge but mainly in standby just in case	2	2
Still the  funniest  reviewer out here hahah  here from  the reccumbu days  sir.all  the best	2	2
One of the few reviewers out there who is not afraid to call out the fruit logo ecosystem for their garbage strategies and half baked expensive craps which they try to pass off as smartphones.	1	1
On a side note, have you ever checked out or did a review on Realme GT7 pro? I remember you making a video on it but I just can’t seem to find it. I could be misremembering it.	1	1
My favourite so far has got to be the honor gt pro. Cameras aside. It's definitely the best value for money	2	2
@TechSpurt pls tell me if I should buy Samsung A35 or nothing phone 3a . Pls let me know . I’m leaning more for camera for content creation and all. But I feel like I also want it to be durable cuz I might hand it over to my mother after a year or so .	1	1
This time I went with the normal s25 for its size. But overall I think that s25 ultra and Honor magic 7 pro are the best overall	2	2
Chainsaw Man though 😁	1	1
Iphone 16e at the thumbnail? Uncle spurt you must secretly love Apple, you even have a dynamic island on your head	2	2
What is on your background library mate	1	1
my favorite tech tuber cheers 😀🍻	1	1
Oneplus or Oppo find x8 pro?	1	1
Watching this on my Samsung a15 5g that just hit an Android 15 update	1	1
One plus 13 definitely but here  i n the usa  well  im eitj  T-Mobile,cant happen  im stuck  with  Samsung galaxy .but my  last  device was the  oneplus 9 pro	1	1
I'm first to comment 😂😂	1	1
"@TechSpurt  Are any of these as good as the Huawei P30 pro?
Looking for a new phone this year, don't know if to go for a mid or full Flagship? 🤔
Thanks. 👍🏻"	2	2
I want one of those one plus nords	1	1
Whenever the writers of TV shows ran out of ideas they would stitch clips together to make a new episode. Hmmm.	1	1
One thing to note is that the accessories for CMF phone 2 pro are sold out everywhere without which it is not that great of a phone	2	2
is it true that xiaomi 15 gets real hot when taking a lot of photos while samsung S25 ultra doesnt get hot?	1	1
certified apple hater🤣(laughably expensive)	1	1
Yo guys, I am looking to get a new phone in August - November time. I currently have a pixel 7 pro. I will have around £1100 - £1200 to spend. I know that phone choices are personal preference but there are so many phones out there that are good and I would like some outside views and thoughts on what I should get or at least think of getting. I won't be getting an iPhone of any kind tho because I prefer Android. I live in the UK and I know that there are some phones that aren't available here. I am open to any phone (like oppo or Google or Samsung or Xiaomi etc). Thanks guys 👍	2	2
Make a video on top flagship killer of 2025?	1	1
Still not understanding your British accent hahahahahahaha sorry i prefer the American accent !	1	1
Just bought the 13r. It's been extremely good so far	2	2
Wtf seriously 😒 best camera oneplus 13 it should be worst camera of the year lol 😂	2	2
unc where the oppo find x8 ultra at?	1	1
Would the Poco F7 have made it on this list, considering that it only released yesterday so it will not have been considered yet I think	1	1
This guy's eyes always makes me think he is knocking one out with a cheese grater.	1	1
Watching this on my OnePlus 13 and astonished that this is your phone of the year thus far.  I absolutely love it, but I'm surprised to hear a channel with your viewership agree.  Cheers fella.	2	2
"Motorola is shit for updates.
The OnePlus 13 is the best over all available in the US. We don't get many options. Thankfully Nothing is available here for midrangers but, only online and possibly Best buy."	2	2
Where did u put the vivo x200 pro. It's available worldwide.	1	1
I heard that the video on the OnePlus 13 strutters quite a lot...	1	1
Foldable awards should be split into two categories, best vertical and best horizontal to be fair	2	2
OnePlus 13 would be the one for me too :)	1	1
If you aren't buying flaship then choose samsung / google / apple. Others dont' give good update policies.  If you are buying budget device only samsung i recommend.	2	2
The intro was way too funny for me 😂	1	1
The Nothing 3a Pro would be perfect for me if it came in a 512gb variant as well...🤔I would probably go OP13 but i just cant justify spending £850 on a bloody phone. There are plenty of decent ones out for about the £500 price point that will do a perfectly good job...	2	2
As always very entertaining. Thank you mate !!!	1	1
Thank you for  the great videos you the best	2	2
After watching you review the honor magic 7pro i decided to get it and after almost 4 months i honestly love it still. Cheers spurt	2	2
Right before the Fairphone 6 came out, deserving the most sustainable phone of the year so far (and let's be honest for the rest of the year!)	1	1
I've had the OP 13 since launch and it's amazing. I definitely wasn't expecting it to win best camera tho. Got a vivo x200 pro being delivered end of the week to replace it	2	2
I'm surprised not many people own the OnePlus 13 (Global) atm.	1	1
"Damn Uncle Spurt.. you chose my OnePlus 13 16/512 Arctic Dawn!! I'm shocked & grateful. 
I got fed up with the three-tier monopoly so I jumped ship & never looked back. The new standard has been set.
OP13 Chinese ROM was released April 2024 but yeah, we got ours New Years. -Cheers from Finland 🇫🇮"	1	1
I have never been into Flagship phones but I want to say I really want a OnePlus 13 with everything has been said about also the VIVO X200 Pro those 2 are really growing on me to buy them.	1	1
I love how you broke everything down step-by-step.	2	2
Mind you I am an enthusiast so I buy phones just because and for the latest tech, as a heavy Samsung user I've bought the iPhone 16 Pro Max at launch. Apple Intelligence drew me into it,  knowing that it would take time though.  But not as much time as needed in retrospect, and I have been running the beta builds. Unprecedented for Apple, having thus used it for 7 months and now testing out the Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Samsung/Google partnership (Gemini makes use of Bixby  in the background for phone tasks) it's clear to me they do offer currently the best AI assistant. Beats Siri + Apple Intelligence by a lot, it's not even close. To me that is where it's at,  phone hardware only goes so far - it's all about the software in 2025,  and AI is a big part of it.	2	2
Bro downplaying how good this camera is (especially with that recording at 4K60 9:38 being so smooth and beautiful) confuses me 😂. It has the best overall camera in a smartphone. The consistency is what makes it so great.	2	2
Been thinking “maybe next year will be worth an upgrade” for years. Still have 11 pro max.	2	2
In iPhone 17 pro max they change main and zoom cameras, it’s 100% info.	2	2
how about the terrible vibration ? it is a must basic option which apple is lacking seriously	0	0
I don't know if we ever gonna get new stuff or features from new phones this days, I think we already reach the peak when it comes to phone innovation.	1	2
Hey chaps! What did you think of the iPhone 16's?? (and will you upgrade to a 17?)	1	1
If you switch apps frequently and run messaging socials. It suddenly stops working until locked. I don’t know what’s wrong with the new phones	0	0
Should I get the Vivo x200 ultra or the Xiaomi 15 ultra	1	1
Still using and loving my 13PM & 13pro, ive had them since launch both are in mint condition. Apple's hardware is so damn good. I had to upgrade my Samsung s22U to the s25U bcz it was a laggy mess. Apple isn't giving me enough reasons if any ti upgrade. Damnit Apple 😂 of course it would be a major upgrade, i just can't justify it when my phone's are running so damn good!!	2	2
I upgraded from S24 Ultra to 16 Pro. The things I noticed the most: everything works very well, the quality of the apps, the camera and speaker quality. Thanx for video ❤	2	2
Not quite sure it's the fastest phone especially when it comes to editing videos,.Im only going off phonebuff and some other YouTube channels	1	1
When should we expect the vivo x200 ultra	1	1
still holding on to the ancient 6s plus, has served me well but im considering upgrading to 16 pro, should i wait or go for it?	1	1
"I’m wondering if the same people that say the “upgrade wasn’t worth it” are the same people who barely skim the surface of everything a given phone has to offer. 

I switched over from android 3 1/2 years ago and I can’t tell you how many features I have taught to lifelong Apple simply because i tinker with every setting possible to see what happens."	1	1
Mr tech chap so handsome and charming. I have the s25 ultra and the iPhone 16 pro max. Apple Ai is half baked. I prefer using the s25 ultra.	2	2
Never had an iPhone, but I'm eyeing that 17 Pro Max.  Hope it's good, been a Samsung guy forever.	2	2
Wired Airpdrop was a joke right ? An oxymoron right in there.	2	2
Going from a 14 base to a 17 pro max in a few months. That’s the plan…unless it sucks	0	0
Brother , I am really confused about which phone I should buy . I watched your Iphone 16 pro max video as well but i don't understand which one is perfect for me . I prefer good video and picture camera ( zoom isn't that much important for me but the quality of the video and pictures is important ) . With a better selfie camera with less noise . Good processing phone with smooth performance and stability and Good OS .Video with Pictures like less noise and good color balance. Zoom isn't that much important for me as I already have Samsung s 23 ultra . Please I am waiting for your reply brother .	1	2
After buying a pixel 9 pro xl, i moved back after 4 weeks to the iphone 16 pro max… google still needs to improve a lot of stuff specially in the camera department, photos are constantly blurry, lack detail specially when the subject is in movement, video quality is so bad thet you need to depend on an online service to make it “better”… it is just a bad phone. So here i am back to the iphone 16 pro max	2	2
Last 6-7 iphones are looking the same - the same thing that happened with iphone 6-7-8 (with s models every other year). That’s 6 years of producing the same phone with 10% better chip or camera that noone really needs. Nobody on earth can tell me that 10% faster phone will make his life or work easier. But now, when they say it will change things with 17 (and still the changes are not “huuugeee” like some of youtubers are presenting), the prices will go up for basically the same phone. Jumping from 8 to X was “hugeeee”. Jumping from 3s to 4 was “hugeee”. But jumping from X to any of the models after - 11,12,13,14,15 or 16 - it’s just small things here and there, nothing major. Apple just have a good marketing. (The same thing applies to Samsung).	1	1
Still on my 13 pro max and about to replace the battery. The stainless steel design look so much better than the 16 pro max line up	0	0
My sons just gone from an iPhone 15 to a Xiaomi 14T Pro and have to say it’s way better in most ways plus you can set the camera up to use like the iPhone . All for £500 . Think apples days are numbers in my household … they have become as boring as f1 😂	1	1
Theme hospital. IYKYK	1	1
"i switched to the 16 plus about a month ago after having the 13 for a year (as my first iphone) and i honestly think its about the same experience. i use the camera button a lot more than i thought i would but i dont use the ai ""features"". and those are like... the only memorable things i can even think about in my experience of using it."	2	2
If 17 looks like this, I'll skip or eventually move to Samsung after 12 years of iPhones. if the mock ups turn out to be true, this will be the ugliest iPhone ever!	1	1
At 5:04 how is he changing those colors?	1	1

Changed battery in my iPhone 13 and rocking it still. Upgrades are minimal in the latest iPhones except for the camera	2	2
"I don't think apple and Samsung ""plateaud"" in their camera tech. They are just not bothered to use money on the R&D for a bigger sensor. Since the consumer buys their very expensive phones anyway. So why bother..."	0	0
I remained with my iphone 15 pro. The 16 did not meet any expectations that were promised to consider upgrading,	1	1
Well i owned the 16pm from launch and lts me tell you the worst phone i ever had (apple) the 15pm was so much better for me at least the camera is a shit and buggy all the time i have to restart the camera app for some reason and audio quality sometimes takes a hit the typing is fking hard and not very responsive sometimes the phone is full of bugs here and there i swear to god i turned on my old iphone 13 now and um using it amd going to buy some top of the line android phone to try it s25 ultra or pixel9 pro woth that shity soc oh well im starting to hate iphones ngl	0	0
Upgraded from base 15 to the 16pm. Gotta say it’s quite a heavy phone. Other than that, it’s a great phone. Better camera, better screen, Great battery life, pro motion.	2	2
Great phone however their AI is still behind from what other Smartphones do	1	1
I upgraded from 13….. I see no difference.	1	1
100% battery capacity with 200+ cycles how's that possible 🤯	1	1
"An iPhone 11 Pro Max user here, this 16PM is still not convincing me to upgrade yet. But I would purchase a price-dropped iPhone 15 Pro Max instead.
I have been using my iPhone 11 ProcMax for 6 years now (bought brand new before COVID-19 outbreak) it still rocking given the battery has been replaced due to aging."	1	1

The telephoto lens is definitely a weak point. Great distance, but it's noticeably worse in low light. I'm still happy overall, but this is where I'd point people to the Pixel 9 Pro series (Chinese phones depend on where you live).	2	2
I’m still rocking a iPhone 13 Pro Max (512GB) this was definitely Peak iPhone!	1	1
Having 16 Pro Max. Very solid phone, but the photo quality is sort of embarrasing compared to android flagships.	0	0
"I was offered An iPhone 16 Pro Max For my S24 Ultra And I'm Glad I didn't Take The iPhone 🤭

9:06 Draco Malfoy is short	1	1
Still enjoying my 16PM, not going to upgrade this year. That leaked dummy units looked hideous imo.	2	2
4:49 Erm, the iphone doesn't have vapour chamber cooling, but it might appear in the 17 Pro however.	1	1
Genuinely can’t believe how much better the images from that Oppo look compared to the iPhone, never thought a day will come when a Chinese Android phone will take much better looking photos than an iPhone	0	2
I had the 14 pro and was good with it, but did upgrade to a 16 pro max cause I wanted a bigger phone, plus more capacity and usb-c. I think I will be good with this one for the next 3-4 years. But I also do agree that Apple peaked with the iPhone's awhile ago.	2	2
I bought 16prm literally 2 days ago upgraded from 14prm . I would say Inlove 14prm more than 16prm. the overheating is constantly making me regret upgrading. Just after 10 minutes of video calling the phone is super hot and 5-10 minutes of watching YouTube it’s again the same. Is it just my device or are they the same for y’all?	0	2
planning to get an iphone as my secondary phone. Been an android users for years and just wanted to try. I dont know if its worth it tho.	1	1

which glasses are you wearing, they are nice :) and i watch your videos they are amazing	1	2
Correct.  Everyone is not a creator.  For those of us who aren't the 16 Pro Max is just a 15 Pro Max with an awkward-to-use and badly placed camera button and embarrassingly awful AI.	0	0
still rocking the 14 pro max and I don't think I'm missing out on a lot yet. Type c will be nice but apple intelligence is still trash (tried it on my ipad and mac)	0	0
Great review il definitely upgrade to the 17 pro max range best wishes from Cheshire	2	2
Had mine since launch, and if you look past the Apple Intelligence fiasco, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is hands down the best iPhone ive ever had, it's just a really good iPhone it does all the things you want it to do, excellently. Screen is amazing, speed is great battery is honestly a joke at times it's so good cameras are really good. if apple didn't promise the AI world this phone wouldn't be looked down upon so much.	2	2
I switched from an iPhone to a Pixel9 pro in December after years, I take more photos. And I'm really happy with the change I made. Hopefully Apple will wake up in the future.	2	2
"Ive moved on to android , at least to vivo x200 u 

Since the iphone x, 13 14 , 16 

The only thing that is great or two 

Is the like the mentioned is decent battery and efficiency 

Decent photos and video 

But overall is the backup icloud and restore and seamless transition between macbooks is ehy im still holding on 


But for daily use and video / photos, x200 ultra will be my main 

Apple dropped the ball on hardware ( apart from SoC ) 

Like the screen, and the camera sensor and lens, and the freaking wifi. For christ sake , i could understand camera and screen but effing WIFI !? 😢"	0	0
I just want to know where you got your tripod from? 😊	1	1
I jumped from iphone 7 to iphone 16 pro and I think it is worth to jump from phone to phone every 5-7 years only.	2	2
5:44 wired airdrop was such a handy tip! Thanks so much! 🔥	2	2
Moved up from iPhone 12 to 16 Pro max must say I was least excited about upgrade. Of course camera are better as is battery life but otherwise it is smallest upgrade for me and I’ve been since 3GS days. Definitely keeping my phone for 2-3 years maybe even more.	2	2
I am sooooooooo bored of my 16 Pro Max. It's just... not it. All the features they promised have either not been delivered or have simply been underwhelming. It'll be my last.	0	0
I have a question about how you set up your battery charge limit to achieve the 100% life after 7-8 months?  Is there a limit set or you charge up to 100%?	1	1
"iPhone 13 Pro since March 2022✅.
Peak iPhone. Anything else is nothing special.
A better chip, a better camera, a better screen are normal things.
A new useless button is...non sense.

People keep your phone until there is a deep change.
If it ain't broke, don't buy a new one."	2	2
honestly 16pro max is best apple from all iphone reason battery high quality videos slomo prfomnce all was insane	2	2
all youtube videos ive watched been saying i should wait for the 17 pro max and i am currently using a 13 pro and its a beast tbh ...i think i might just actually wait for the 17 pro max especially with the new ios 26	1	1
am I going crazy or is there some dust or crumbs on the phone in the thumbnail? I had to click just to say that	0	0
Meh. Xiaomi & Vivo best now. Change my mind.	1	1
This man knows his phones!  My iPhone 15 still has 99% battery health after 203 charge cycles	1	2
"Thinking about buying a second hand/almost new iPhone 14/14 pro.
Both are around 500 Euros, one on eBay and one on Backmarket.

I read last week that Apple was going to use an anti reflective screen coating like Samsung. But they scrapped it	1	1
iPhone 17 lineup is a stupid design.	0	0
my iphone 16PM is pretty buggy. maybe its an ios 18 thing, but i regret upgrading from my iphone 13	0	0
Can you recommend a budget bluetooth microphone?	1	1
"I upgraded from 14Pro and night photos,  battery life, speakers and gaming performance is like x2 better, photographic styles was handy in certain pictures and camera control lets just say needs time, but it’s a fun thing.
About apple intelligence, well Apple really has to work on that, and they really should have advertised 16 series with photography, not the beta ai which doesn’t work in many situations."	2	2
14 pro max is the best	1	1
I was thinking of getting the 16 pro max but don’t want to feel disappointed if the 17 is better 🧐	0	0
I watch these just to laugh at how reviewers desperately try to make content out of minimal generational changes	0	0
Sold my 16 pro max (4 months old) and switched to Vivo x200 Pro and Oneplus watch 3. I should have done this long back. Enjoying the freedom of control and customisation of my phone now 😅 and superb camera quality of vivo is icing on the cake 😂	0	0

I have both iPhone 16 PM and S25U and I really cannot get used to the iPhone screen sensitivity and the keyboard typing experience is not as smooth as any other Android phones. I don't know how to make it better	0	0
"I'm disappointed with Apple I truly wish they didn't annoyance AI stuff at all. I think it was more about appeasing investors than customers because I don't think (everyday) people have been that pressed for AI on their phones. Wish Apple would've went their usual route of only bring something up when it's ready. Though Siri is noticeable better about answering instead of saying ""I found these search results""
P.S. my 15 pro has been solid BUT the processing does struggle more times than not."	1	1
You made this so easy to understand.	2	2
As a tech reviewer I tend to not be biased, but let's call a rock, a rock here, Apple has seriously fallen behind and lost the plot. A year in tech is a lifetime, that's a long enough time to lose customer base, let other brands innovate and surpass Apple. One thing here, the Vivo X200 Pro has better video recording than the Iphones already, and it uses a log format that's easier to colour grade. Times are a changing, and it's not going to be kind to companies that cant keep up, or make promises they can't keep...	0	0
Going to upgrade 13 to 17 maybe 17 pro	1	1
I am upgrading from an iPhone 11. Definitely got my 5 years out of it. Hope this new 16 will last as long. 😊	2	2
For the first time since the iPhone 4 I didn’t upgrade to a new iPhone last year, just because the iPhone 16 felt so boring to me that I didn’t even care to upgrade. I kept my iPhone 15 Pro Max for another year. To add, for the last week I’ve been testing the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I’m mad a myself for becoming so dependent on the Apple ecosystem, because this phone blows out of the water every iPhone that has come out in the last 3 years. Apple became lazy.	0	0
I can’t wait get my iPhone 16 pro max gold with 1TB I think apple is doing very well is year	2	2
I've just purchased the Huawei Pura 80, because I live in China every phone on the market is available.	1	1
"So it's just about the cameras? What about the real world use of the phone in terms of ease of use,  useful features, and productivity??? But noooo it's just all fluff about tech specs. I highly doubt you even used these devices. 

This is a stupid list."	2	2
I have a S25 Edge, and I love it.  The light weight makes it easy to hold when I am watching TV on my phone	2	2
I actually think the OnePlus 13 camera system beats other flagships in the UK. I prefer the colour science	1	1
I enjoy looking at the comments saying x is the best by miles. Thanks for fueling the arguments 🍿	2	2
You all know yall use iphones	1	1
If Iqoo 13 had Vivo X200 Ultra cameras...its basically the same phone.	1	1
I've tried 4 of the 5 and own the oneplus and ultra 25. I find it impossible to choose between the two.  Seems this year might be a tie for me unless Nothing does something really special.	1	1
Why no folding phones could have gone with a fold 6	1	1
Bro why you dont make a video without glasses??	1	1
Which is the best smart phone in 2025...…?	2	2
Do not buy Oneplus  - if you don't want green lines.	1	1
Saf you and I both know that it should have been the vivoX200 ultra in the top 5 list instead of the xiaomi 15 ultra if the vivoX200 ultra had a global release by now. Sad.	1	1
I have never used iphone before, and I really wish to, even if it's Iphone 2 especially for my ASMR channel	1	1
My fold 4 is up in August (ish) have been thinking about the Magic 7 pro, annoying some others as mentioned arent available in the UK, please can you do a fold version of this video, im not sure if i stay with a fold or back to a bar phone, thanks	2	2
Wheres Iphone 😂	1	1
Honor 400 pro all the way ❤🎉	1	1
I have the IPhone for banks and other and Vivo for photos and entertainment. I think it’s the best all around setup you can get (instead of iPhone you can get some mid core Honor for 350$ with face scanner, same level of security but less expensive. I promise it’s the best phone setup you can have	2	2
I've been fortunate to have every top phone this year including s25 ultra, plus and edge, iPhone 16 pro and pro max, OnePlus 13, Xiaomi 15 ultra, oppo find x8. I am hyper fussy and specific in what I look for in a phone. Have to say that as yet there has not been a phone in this list that ticks every box for me however the OnePlus 13 hits most of the boxes. The only thing that lets it down for me (personally) was the offset camera . I hoped the oppo find x8 was going to be the phone that addressed this but lost out due to poor fingerprint sensor location and dreadful haptics. The honor magic 7 pro is a high contender and next on my list and could take the spot from the OnePlus 13	0	0
Agree with your list here	1	1
Bro the best camera has the new realesed Huawei Pura 80 Ultra	2	2
Great Video😊	2	2
Remember guys, we can still be friends 😂 What are your favourite smartphones of 2025 so far?	1	1
I have mine one and only IPhone 16 pro. I didn’t consider anything else💁‍♀️	1	1
2025 still 6months is their😊	1	1
"@1:01 Even thou this list about 2025 phones
Still they want to do paid promotion for iphone 16 Pro Max which was released on 2024 lol
Strange"	1	1
The editing mehn. Daaamn	1	1
Listing flagships of all manufacturers, lol wow so creative	1	1
watching with my x200 ultra🎉	1	1
Interesting list. A lot of these phones are not available or barely available in the US so its not relevant to me.	1	1
European variant Honor Magic 7 Pro is watching enthusiastically 🤓	1	1
Best smartphone without A.I?	2	2
The S24 Ultra is the best phone I have ever used. Exceptional battery life, very good UI, Dolby Atmos, Screen.....	2	2
Doesn't matter what's coming rest of the year when Vivo X200 Ultra already exist.	1	1
honor magic 7 pro or iphone 15 pro max	1	1
but guys what if im in a very tight bufget ...what would u recommend me	1	1
5yrs of software and security updates should be the least and normalised in mobile phones.	1	1
Definitely the Huawei Pura 70	1	1
How could you leave off the Google Pixal 9 pro?	1	1
Why not mentioning poco f7 ultra???	1	1
I got Vivo X200 Ultra last month - it is such a beast!	1	1
OnePlus 13 phone of the year.	1	1
X200 Ultra is basically Iqoo 13 with a flagship camera setup 😊	1	1
No foldables? I would've thought the Oppo Find N5 would top some categories.	1	1
Love the reviews!! Can you recommend Samsung or Google messages to use on S24 plus. Thanks	2	2
Front 3D ToF facial recognition on Android first begun with the Huawei P40..back in 202..5yr old tech	1	1
Just bought the S25 Ultra omggg🎉	1	1
Bro shave that hair, there's no point in keeping it, you'll be much happier	1	1
Take out the S25u and throw in the S24u instead	1	1
I am a big fan of yours and always watch your videos! I don't have a smartphone yet and Samsung Galaxy S25 can be my first phone, if you give it to me then it will be my biggest wish. It has 12GB RAM, great camera and latest features. Please give me a chance to gift my first smartphone, I will be forever grateful to you! ❤️	2	2
Vivo x200 Pro has been my daily driver for 6 months now and I can't get enough of it! No envy for the ultra. I prefer global ROMs.	1	1
Should have added Vivo x200 pro or  X200 ultra	1	1
One plus 13 all the way... All the speca and half the price!!❤	1	1
Saf, any chance you can do a camera test comparison between Xiaomi 15 Ultra vs Oppo Find X8 Ultra vs Vivo X200 Ultra? Thanks	2	2
Less hair time, more timestamp time.	1	1
"using Oneplus 13, the best performance, camera, battery, os in every aspect 
samsung needs to cm out of 5k mah battery especially S25 ultra feels same older version of ultras. Vivo,xiaomi,iqoo r bringing best techs as weel"	2	2
Xiaomi, Redmi must really improve when it comes to updates. It's really frustrating.	1	1
Dont import the oppo! It wont work 100%. Since its got chinese android on it... Hopefully x9 x10 will be global	1	1
Samsung 25 ultra and Google pixel 9 pro xl are the best	2	2
Did anyone ever hear about honour after sale services?	1	1
"As a niche, I'd say the best phone for me is Red Magic 10 Pro. Idk about the 10s yet. I'm hoping to see more on-hand gaming reviews and thermal checks and if everything checks out to be better, I'll get it. Especially considering the price of the 1TB model.

I'll probably get a Samsung next year if they're not complacent again. I do prefer the S series to be my main phone as I still have my S21 ultra. Banger phone, but considering everything I've seen from the RM10, it definitely made my S21 feel old now"	2	2
9:30 So Sony makes the best camera sensors for others, but not for its own phones?	2	2
"When will Samsung Flagship phones have 6000mAh battery 
Why only Mid-range phones get bigger 🔋 
If the make S26 Plus Thicker with 6000mAh battery just for once & see the Sales for themselves"	1	1
This is cowardice, you already say it's your opinion, why not place then in order of your preference	1	1
"It's not true that the early release phones get forgotten at the end of the year. The S ultra of that year always takes one of the top awards, if not the ""MVP""."	1	1
Xiaomi 15 be sitting back this time	1	1
We can still be friends 😂	1	1
I absolutely love my iPhone 16 pro Max but it feels so far behind compared to a lot of these phones	2	2
"I'm watching this video on my new Vivo X200 Ultra. Google services and Android Auto works perfectly, you can uninstall almost every chinese apps and even turn on Circle to search. This is android guys, if you want you can do anything with your phone 😂
P.S. camera is godlike"	1	1
I use iphones but if i would ever go back to android i would deff go for the vivo imo	1	1

This was so helpful, thank you!	2	2
"Honestly dont think the S25 Ultra is worth it over the other Ultra options. X200 Ultra has FAR better cameras, better battery life and charging speeds, better IP rating, IR blaster, AND is cheaper. 

Samsung really needs to step it up, they are getting left behind by Chinese brands and its really not even close anymore."	1	1
People are sleeping on the Magic 7 Pro!	1	1

Who is here before 71M? Cause we all know views are gonna increase on this video after Lew's new video on iphone bendgate. Good Job Lew.	2	2
Ah man. I used to own this device. Luckily it never had a bend. I was really paranoid it would happen so I checked every chance I got if it had bent.	1	1
Wow, it feels like I'm back in 2014 again after watching this	1	1
Do you realize that is this video had 2 million more views, it would be viewed by about 1% of the entire population of humans on planet Earth. That's 1 out of every 100 people on this planet.	1	1
Technical Guruji should learn something from you	1	1

Sounds like you intentionally tried to make your voice deeper back then how embarrassing	1	1
"I have an iphone 6, and today I noticed that it is slightly bended.
I feel betrayed by Apple and there seemingly ""Quality"".

In response to the people that say the bending of my phone is my own fault, this is the only thing I have to say:

If I buy something of this ""Quality"" there should not be an risk of getting damaged under normal use. If people would blame me for bending my phone, they might as well blame me for getting struck by lightning because I was walking outside of the protection of my house..."	1	1
Who came here after the iPhone 12 bend test?	1	1

The phone still bent... I dont see why the time really matters? It still bends pretty easily for something supposedly made out with titanium reinforcements, no? Whether it was the first time or fifth time, it was bent. 	1	1
Who is after i phone 12 bend test	1	1

This did not happen if you immediately put your phone into an OtterBox defender case, life proof FRE, or any other hard shell poly carbonate case with or without a TPU layer. It’s only happened to folks who used those very flexible silicone cheap cases knock off brands or carry them bareback. The 6000 series aluminum that Apple used in the iPhone 6 and 6+ was the main culprit. This never happened again as soon as Apple upgraded to a 7000 series aluminum which debuted in the iPhone 6s series	1	1

"I switched from the Apple ecosystem to Samsung.  I was having issues with car play dropping and issues with connecting.  My daughter is having the same issues. Now that I am with Samsung and Android I have never had an issue.  I now have the Samsung watch and S10 + tablet and all work together seamlessly. Plus once my S25 Ultra, everything set itself up and I haven't had any issues at all.  My Apple 15pro max and iPad pro M4 13"" didn't sync,especially with emails and messages. I will never go back to Apple. Once with Apple you are stuck with it. There is so much more flexibility with Android."	2	2
I carry both these phones…I am deep in the IPhone ecosystem but the Samsung phone is clearly a better faster phone that can take excellent photos…..IPhone is left in the dust by samsung	2	2
I don't understand why the youtubers compare iphones and androids. Iphones don't sell their phones they sell ios and their insane cameras that shoot amazing videos. See this comparison is pointless the s25 ultra will beat iphone 16 pro in all the areas specification wise. But iphone users don't see that in iphones. It's really important to understand that. Yes on paper the s25 ultra is a better phone but there are other aspects where iphone beats the s25 ultra. And I'm not saying that in those areas the s25 ultra can't do well but there are some things that the iphone just does better. Why do you think all the celebrities, most content creators and most filmmakers have an iPhone that's because iphones just do social media better its more optimized. Videos on the iphones are really nice. And not to mention their phones running on ios is just a different experience all together. Yes for me if I were to pick between one of them then I will go for the s25 ultra but if I was heavy on social media and videography or had a lot of followers on Instagram I will close my eyes and go for the iphone.	2	2
Here I am with my pixel 7 and hating how far behind Google is on smartphones.	2	2
I believe your assessment is largely accurate. However, a crucial category you might have overlooked is service and repair. For instance, I can get an Apple device serviced in about an hour. I’m not certain if Samsung can match this level of service. Nevertheless, if the Chinese continue to improve at their current pace, both Samsung and Apple could potentially lose their positions on the world stage.	1	1
As a long time iPhone user, I’m planning on switching to the Pixel line when the 10 releases. I’ve owned the Pixel 2XL and it was awesome! I did briefly consider the Samsung line but I just can’t get past One UI and the bloatware.	1	1
Use what you like. Who cares what us nerds think.	1	1

This video appears to be sponsored by Apple or the maker is biased. Made it to 2:45 and I'm gone.	0	0
"Are you serious right now?
Samsung and Android have have the top row down quick settings menu for a very long time ever used to have the quick settings menu from the downside and up into the assistant Apple can even half of Gemini can do"	2	2
"I have.
 An iPhone 15 promax and  the S23 Ultra. Honestly samsung is better when it comes to tuning the animations to your liking customization with themes and keyboards. And has an amazing 200 megapixel camera. Also a great selfie camera. Iphone on the other hand is better in the sense that when you use it, it just works really well and you don't have to do nothing. Animations of battery smove opening the closing apps are buttery smooth. I love dynamic island. And I also like that when you Check-in notifications and you swipe from the left down. It takes you to the lock screen with Siri. Yes, I have a nice lock screen wallpaper while checking notifications. Well on Samsung, it's pretty basic though you could make it transparent for there'snow background. Battery life is amwzing on both ill stick with both lol idc two phones for me it is!!!"	2	2
I stopped watching your video right there when you said siri is better than gemini 😂 paid paid paid	2	2
Talking about speaker, you're the only person who has given the win to iPhone	2	2
Thank you	1	2
"I’m beginning to doubt your credibility. 
The iPhone pro max is always heavier than the Samsung, so it’s not only this year where the Samsung is lighter. 

Besides, after your conclusion, you don’t have to tell us what you personally use. All those apple products you mention are not part of the iPhone. It’s a stand alone comparison between the two. Thank you."	2	2
Even before I see the last part of your video I knew you'r an iPhone'r.  I use both (with iPhone as main) and I know exactly how an iOS user looks at both.	1	1
you know whatt....since theres so much of confusion so im gonna go for both of em and btw in india the samsung s25 ultra (rs. 1,29,000) and iphone 16 pro max (1,44,990) that is the iphone is more expensiv in india so it just depends on ur region for the prices............nicely done and appreciate ur work man.............ur review built up a lotta clarity for me.......keep up the good work	2	2
What a load of crap	0	0
it's so boring video	0	0
Ive had widgets on my samsung phones for a very long time, and i remember when Apple copied that, so are we specifically talking about lock screen widgets?	1	1
when you said Siri is the better assistant, I closed your video	0	0
We love a swiftie🥰	2	2
I like this review. Thanks for giving praise to the Samsung 😊	1	1
I've had my 16 Pro max for 6-7 months now. Battery health is still 100% after 76 cycles. I have it at 80% charge and it lasts all day. Fastest chip on the market, never gets hot. Cameras are good and a very durable build. Extremely fast processing speed and apps are optimized. I have no complaints, this is the best iPhone ever made and I think it's way better than the s25 ultra considering the processing power, cooling capacity and overall how polished apps are on iOS.	2	2
The iSung Pro Ultra is the best	2	2
Couldn’t go wrong with either phones they’re both amazing I currently have 16 Pro Max. My girlfriend has the has 25 ultra ❤ she has had a few issues with it being slow after an update im not smart with Samsung another then that it’s definitely amazing 🙏  both great phones	1	1
Ain't no way you picked Siri as the winner. I follow the ios sub on Reddit and it's full of siri complaints all day everyday. You should do an in depth video Siri vs Gemini in speed, functionality and accuracy.	1	0
first time here, why do you sound like A.I ?	2	2
I started with Iphone 4 all the way to Apple X then I decided to switch to Samsung because of 1 reason... planned obsolescence by Apple which I noticed way back when I have my IPhone 5 and I heard about it when I have my IPhone X	1	1
Ya no one likes the camera control button. I disabled it immediately. It ruined thousands of cases. I can’t stand it. I almost want to downgrade just so its not there.	0	0
I moved to Samsung after 20 years as iPhone user.. and this should make Apple to wonder, since they are losing also alsto the loyal customers... and it is simple: Samsung is really much more ahead than Apple.. Apple arrives always late than Saumsung/Androind and the price they sell it is not fair anymore for what they really offer you... that's it	2	2
"Hello Sir … what would be your recommendation for long term use … S25 Ultra or, IPhone 16 Pro ??? 

In India 🇮🇳 prices are almost same of these two sets . And I’m a Writer by profession and don’t play games or watch movies on smartphone ever . 

Need your advice 🙏"	1	1
iPhone ❤	1	1
Reasons I cannot use iPhone: 1 no universal back gesture works all over the system, 2 cannot use 3rd party fully functional T9 dialer, 3 cannot use fully functional 3rd party keyboard... and many many more reasons...	0	2
You lost me at Siri being the winner. Show some transparency - you made this comparison because you have to fulfill that sponsorship didn’t you?	0	0
Thorough video though seems a bit slanted. I'm sticking with iPhone because the apps are much better and the app diversity is too.	2	2
Gemini's speed and voice recognition accuracy are still its biggest issues and no one's talking about em. Not even Google cares.	1	1
I like Samsung I've never had a iPhone bc it was always so expensive plus I don't use a lot of apple products so iphone comparability isn't necessary	2	2
"""For the first time like ever s25u ulta is the lighter phone"" 
U totally forgot how insanely heavier iPhones were when they didn't use titanium?"	0	0
What I like on the iPhone are Face ID, haptic and most importantly the interface	2	2
S25 Ultra. Definitely.	2	2
Buy a camera for a camera not a smart phone camera because over processed photos yet taking pictures with a camera and going into every photo editing tool known to man to make it look good 🤣	2	2
Im using s21 ultra and iPhone 16 pro max,but believe me my 4 years old samsung is way better then iPhone 16,areas like typing, dual screen, spen,Bluetooth connection to any device without compromising sound quality which iPhone reduces the sound quality if it's not connected to apple devices, and the fun is using free apps on android including Google storage for free,which apple wants you to pay for everything 😊	2	2
Thank you.	2	2
I have the s23 ultra and I'm seeing this super sharpened photos too. Any setting to turn it off? or turn it down a notch?	1	1
1:22 i really miss the bixby button not because i can activate bixby whenever, but you can use third-party remapping tools to customize the button with whatever action you wanted	1	1
My ecosystem is Samsung, and it is flawless. I still have Dex mode, which is incredible (I use it for daily work). Earphone integration works really well! I love it!	2	2
Unless you’re some type of professional photographer, no one is carrying a dedicated camera around. Flagship smartphones at this point do more than enough for daily and vacation photos for most. Now if it’s a wedding or something, then you hire photographers!	2	2
America has draft tactics, such as watches or different types of cellular devices. If you have the intelligence to use certain devices or watches, With that intelligence then your drafted. Even your name, you can be drafted because your name is Michael	1	1
I have both and I like the S25 Ultra better. Only thing keeping me on iPhone imessage and Facetime.	2	2
easy choice. I love the S25. but I have Apple everything. So to go with My Asus ROG strix I have the S25 as my main phone with galaxy watch. and the iPhone pro max 16 as my secondary phone for my MacBook Pro 16 and IMac and iPad Pro and apple watch And I use both all day long. So why compare when you can use both.	2	2
sound like Iphone fun boy not good, need not to watch you any more.	2	2
Just take the iPhone it’ll age better	2	2
Lol, he gave the win to Siri. That is hilarious.	2	2
Bro which has better haptics???	2	2
Apple iPhone 16 Pro is better because of the ecosystem. I have an M4 Air, and along with AirPods Pro 2, everything works together seamlessly.	2	2
"Just found your channel and I really like the ""6 months later"" review concept. But why do you look constipated in all of your thumbnails?"	1	2
To me it’s about preference. I switched to the 15 pro max after the atrocity that was the S22 ultra and now I have the 16pro max. I’ve never been more satisfied with a smart phone and I was a Samsung loyalist since 2009. I hated iPhone without ever having one. iPhone just work more consistently for me.	1	1
I've switched since iP14promax and mostly Apple devices to the Samsung Eco system because I was bored with the iPhone, I still use a mac studio and macbook pro, but replaced my phone and tablet and watch for top of the line Samsung products. Instead of iCloud I use OneDrive and so far so good. Also syncs on my PC and laptop (iCloud could also do that though). Samsung phones are really good and oneUI destroys iOs for me now. First time ever since smartphones I switched to Android and not going back anytime soon (if ever). Also ordered a nice Samsung laptop because I like windows better than MacOS since W11.	2	2
josh is so cute 🥵 and he's also a swiftie 😍	2	2
I’m an iPhone guy but you can’t go wrong with almost any high end Android phone. Fortunately we have a ton of great options and it’s easier to switch back and forth between operating systems.	1	1
This guy looks like Zack Morris from SBTB	1	1
Stopped watching when you gave the assstant win to iPhone…apple fan boy detected	2	2
Youre actually wrong about both having 120hz displays	0	0
I would love to have an iPhone again for the watch alone but 0 intelligence features and some lacking features like clipboard to name one of many is just too much	2	2
bro gave point to apple for pricing, bros world is only his country or he lives in the space? s25 ultra in my country costs 300$ less than iphone at the time of me typing this comment (you cannot just say pricing according to only one country lil kid	1	1
iPhone 16 pro max is what I’m using, and I feel secured in every aspect. I tried S24 Ultra, but I really am not secured and confident while using S24 ultra. I’m back to Apple iPhone  with 16 pro max.	1	1
Spec wise the s25 ultra is better in every way but the iphone is so optimized that it'll be on par or just slightly slower than the s25 ultra. Also if we talk about gaming, iphone games I feel are more optimized. Also with the iphone you get a lot of other things that you don't get with the s25 ultra that is the best smart watch, seamless airpods connection with all its features, seamless connection between the iphone and MacBook. If you're a editor editing on a MacBook its a no brainer to be using an iPhone. So its all that when it comes to iphones and people's preference towards the phone. But yeah just solely talking about the phone no phone in the world comes close to the beast itself, the powerhouse and the ultimate phone yes ofcourse I'm talking about the s25 ultra😂😂	2	2
I can’t watch these sponsored fake review vids anymore!	0	0
The way i choose between the 2, if i prefer to be more productive, i go with samsung s25 ultra. If i prefer more social media uploads, then i go with iphone 16 pm.	2	2
Some nifty features are overlooked in this comparison. For example: very much useful AI, very efficient S-pen, very helpful Galaxy routine, Reverse charging and so on.......!!! Samsung made my life very easy TBH!	2	2
"Nothing compares to IOS. Most people are too dumb to understand design language and tiny details but everything about IOS is just perfection. 
They just get it, simple as that. 
Buy the phone you like, but Apple is just the kind of design language. And they don’t glue their camera rings on……"	2	2
Android 16 desktop mode will be a full linux thing.	2	2
I agree with Siri being faster than gemini. I only use siri to make calls and it is faster. I’m more of an android guy but siri is significantly faster. I don’t know why no one on YouTube talks about this.	2	2
13:55 What am I seeing here? Nothing happens on the iPhone?	1	1
3:25 yeah because its super important that when I watch videos that the phone is I hold it at a angle and not directly in front of me.	2	2
S25 Ultra overheating, camera lag, camera lenses ring popping off, removed Bluetooth from S Pen, short battery life, screen coating rubbing off and dull screen all well documented on Samsung Community website. Glad cancelled order and hope S26 Ultra does better! Samsung needs better Engineers in their phone division indeed!	2	2
"Queria poder ter os dois hehehe
I with have both! 😂✌️"	1	1
Samsung DOES have a much larger ecosystem of devices than you think. 'Smart Things' app can literally control everything in your house way better than Home Kit. You can have a Samsung laptop, headphone, tablet, and watch all working in 1 ecosystem. You can then connect to your Samsung TV and control all sorts of apps. Furthermore, you can also use Google TV which works seamlessly with Samsung. The point being if you bought into all of the Samsung devices, you can live an Apple-free life.	1	1
Samsung got robbed on the mic quality test, over the video the samsung sounded way clearer imo.	2	1
"I'm a Windows 💻 user and S25 Ultra is, overall a better phone.
Android and Windows work great together so S25 Ultra ✅."	2	2
Just adding one more thing . No phone in the world comes close to the overall performance of the s25 ultra except for the oneplus 13 its actually a really close contender but still not better than the s25 ultra. Yeah its just that good can't do anything about it.	2	2
One aspect of the Samsung ecosystem that you missed was that they also make appliances and home theater.  I have a Samsung range.  I can get a notification when it is preheated on my TV, tablet, watch, and phone if I want.	1	1
S25 Ultra is on another level 🔥	1	1
iOS is not as good as Android in Quality of Life Features - Android just has so many more where even basic android phones has features that IOS doesn’t have such as back gestures, clipboard, notification history, different sound level options, no mentioning how many hours till alarm rings, notification history, makes pip for maps amongst others	2	2
I agree totally. I have both phones. I do think Samsung has an overall better experience. I love the buds pro 3 but I use my iPhone more since I also have AirPod maxes, MacBook Pro and iPad Pro and an Apple Watch.	2	2
Believe me samsung does not want that hideous notch/dynamic island on their phones.	1	1
He’s biased. Can anyone who’s had both phones for a while lmk which ones better?	0	0
This review better than the first one	1	1
Please vivo change Ur camera design looking ugly🙏🙏	0	0
When you're finished with the phone could I have it please?	1	1
I am from Ghana,west Africa...i need a phone to start content creation... I'd be happy to have this...I know this comment might get lost in the mass but hey, it doesn't hurt to try ...	2	2
So in conclusion, this phone is a 10 once you realize Origin OS has zero drawbacks for 99% of users.	1	1
Vivo must consider releasing ultra version with kit on global markets	1	1
Ops! Long John sorry about the news feed, it really looks tasty never the less that camera is superb I wonder what it will be like after the updates.	2	2
Wallpaper name?	1	1
Total thickness with bump 15.7mm.	1	1
Issue is i dnt like curve display, why this phone doesn’t make flat display	1	1
thank you for showing Chinese artefacts of the OriginOS, which rarely reviewers talk about in details. It's a great phone, but I'm not sure I'd be able to get along with these hieroglyphs all over the place :/	2	2
Why does wear os not work ? So my galaxy watch ultra will not work on this device ?	1	1
Would you recommend this over the Xiaomi 15 ultra? Based in the UK but never had a Chinese ROM before. Just debating if its worth the hassle/long term use? Battery on my Xiaomi has been awful!	1	1
I'm loving my x200 Ultra so far. Got it Saturday and it's been so good after I found out how to make third party launchers work	2	2
We want a global version!	1	1
Will this get a UK release?	1	1
Are these phones reliable? Vivo, rivo, oppo etc?	1	1
Like to see a long term on the Oppo Ultra, it's China only again but heard the do a better job making it less Chinesey when setting it to English, be nice to get some confirmation.	1	1
Wait, so no HDR support on Netflix? I thought it was supported?	1	1
An hour ago i was looking for a proper review of X200 Ultra and i just settled for a few camera review videos. Just as i finished them this got recommended to me lol, thanks!	2	2
What's the point when we can't buy it outside China	1	1
Nah.. MKBHD will still say Iphones have better cameras.	1	1
Samsung has like 2 duplicate apps now.	1	1
An excellent device, and probably one of the best options around the world if money is no issue. But if money is an issue an old aps-c DSLR with a 135mm prime lens will be far less expensive and last many years more. This extraordinary device could be an excellent companion for somebody serious about photography, but if you are serious then you already have a dedicated camera I imagine. And if you aren't serious then using it for selfies and food won't be different than using any other smartphone 🤔	2	2
Chinese.. meh. No thanks.	2	2
Fair play for correcting your Google mistake	1	1
Got the Redmagic 10 Pro after a couple of your reviews and a whole bunch of spec searching! I've been absolutely loving it the past days	1	1
I don't understand why vivo only makes Chinese versions of these phones	1	1
I'm sticking with my x200 pro. The camera bump on the ultra was too much for my liking.	1	1
I like big heavy phones, I have Asus ROG phone 6 so this one won't be too big, I have big pockets in wide pants and if I want a small phone, I put the card in p30 pro or in old nokia 😅	1	1
"Maybe because of the software and ""less ugly"" it is better to import oppo😂"	0	0
What's the name of the show at 7:50?	1	1
Which phone is better over all oneplus 13 or vivo x200 ultra please ?	1	1
Almost the best? I wonder what he thinks is the best	2	2
Unpopular opinion: iphone SE 2016 was enough for me as a phone with a camera	1	1
Any idea how you can change the region of this phones, since Booking and Spotify are directly detecting the region based on the phone and not the location in order to login in and it is always China which makes the login impossible?	1	1
"all new phones are ""the best"""	2	2
Thanks for checking out my Vivo X200 Ultra review! Still gutted there isn't a proper global version with a proper Google implementation, WearOS etc, but there's a lot to love here. Let us know your thoughts below! Cheers xx	2	2
Best Camera phone of 2025***	2	2
2:24 What he talking about?	1	1
Unc should I buy this or the Oppo X8 ultra?	1	1
Can't wait for uncle spurt to review the oppo find x8 Ultra❤	1	1

"Idk why the heck you are complaining about this chinese things.
This is china only launch, it's not the global version."	1	1
Ahhhhh he don't like the VIVO now because AVERAGE DAD TECH gave him a kick up the backside for being wrong about the phone	1	1
He was the best, until dad Xperia 1 VII arrived 😂😂	2	2
Better than oppo find x8?	1	1
Even though he is a bit sketchy which's i never have a problem with it. Know what, other phone king reviews channel seeing him in the brightside😲. People liked his cmf 2 pro phone reviews from uncle techspurt. Vivo x200 ultra sure that is a savage phone to me😎, i liked every single bit of drips on it Vivo x200 ultra no complaints. Close to perfection.	1	1
"Really impressed by the x200ultra apart from two deciding factors.
1. Availability in the UK
2. Short period of security updates compared with other major suppliers.
Such a shame as it's camera is top notch"	1	1
Your english way too intellectual	1	1
15:43 Big Show on the drums.	1	1
Honestly, at this point just create a phone like K Zoom	1	1
Thank you for correcting the google staff .. this ultra phone don't need anything more than global. Everything working fine no problem.	1	1
"Decent review, proves once and for all Average dad would get anyone to buy any old crap as long as he makes a penny. 

Crap phone."	1	1
First one ! I need to know	1	1
The only thing I dont like in Vivo phones is they copy Apple UI, Interface, icons and dont have AI Options like Samsung..	1	1
I just don't like the bump on camera design so big	1	1
Greetings from Brazil🇧🇷	1	1
"If it would be global i would have bought the complete package.

Nah this IS the phone of the year as far as Android is concerned. Aint nothing touching this for a long time	1	1

They got me with That bypass charging  🤝👍	1	1
Is Chinese software good? Specifically opppo and oneplus	2	2
Sad that this is not global. Not supporting companies that do this.	1	1
Vivo should just throw funtouch into the bin, originOS miles ahead even against hyperos and coloros	1	1
"🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hi. I really need your opinion — it's the only one I trust :) I'm very inspired by the Vivo X200 Ultra camera, but I'm unsure about the 35mm main lens. I'm used to a 24mm lens on my professional camera for years, and I’m not sure how I’ll feel using 35mm all the time. Still, I understand the importance and image quality benefits of 35mm. That's why I'm considering the 200 Pro instead — but no bloggers compare the Ultra and the Pro directly. I can’t tell how much better the Ultra really is. Would it be smarter to go with the global version of the Pro rather than the Ultra with a Chinese ROM?

And if I do choose the Pro, is it worth paying extra for the global version, or is the Chinese ROM with some tweaks just as good or even better in terms of optimization and quality? 😭"	2	2
Please	1	1
That's why i went for the Vivo x200 ultra. It might not have the bells and whistles of the ultra camera. But the size really is perfect	1	1
PLEASE COMPARE IT WITH IPHONE	1	1
Did you have any cellular issues using the device? It’s my only concern	1	1
so is there any workaround for wearOS watches on this phone or not? on some china rom phones you can get it working. if not what is the smart watch you could recommend for replacing galaxy watch ultra	1	1
After some messing about I was able to register for a Vivo account on my computer using my email address. After that I was able to log in to it on my Vivo phone and take advantage of the extra features.	1	1
I see the direction Vivo is going and I like it! Their almost able to use the same sensor for all three focal lengths! Imagine the day where lenses and sensors get optimised to the point where they can use 1 inch sensors for all of them.	1	1
We need to go back to having normal-sized phones with crazy, creative designs that aren't just giant white bricks with a giant, bumpy circular camera lenses that cover 50% of the back. Sure we do love having nice cameras but I dont want to cary a camera that is also a phone in my pocket, I want a phone that is also a camera.	2	2
I think this is one of those cases where calling it camera island is abso-bloody-lutely valid and justified... 😁	1	1
We all just need a global version	1	1
Such a shame its not going to be a global release, no wear OS support and no circle to search means no way for me	1	1
Great job by Allen, gave us the specs and the good and not so good aspects of the shoes. Thanks for another great video from Weartesters.	2	2
Great review! The only thing I personally like about the GT Cut 2 is the insole. For me, GT Cut 1 has been the most perfect hoop shoe for my feet. But I do wish it had more cushion in the heel, since they've bottomed out pretty quick. With the GT Cut 2, when I cut hard, the upper material has no give so it's pretty painful for my feet (rip-stop kite material). The GT Cut 1 feels much better and comfortable all around. So I decided to swap insoles and put the GT Cut 2 insoles inside my GT Cut 1, I can't go back to anything else. It's the most perfect set-up for me. Too bad it takes 2 pairs to make my favorite pair.	2	2
Another great review from Allen. The weartesters are all doing great and providing very insightful reviews. Thank you.	2	2
The lacing system for GT cut 2 is horrible. It doesn't contain my heel and i feel like it's gonna slip out	0	0
For me, comparing this with the Lebron 20s, I’d prefer the GT Cuts. For some reason, it’s super cushioned plus the drop-in midsole form makes my foot want to propel forward (and the comfort plus bounce is just crazy). Whereas with the LeBrons, it’s too low for me in my opinion then its cushlon midsole makes my foot sink in more.	1	1
Allen with another great review!!💯🙏	2	2
Really solid review. 6:24 is a great piece of info to help with the tongue movement.	2	2
Been waiting on the performance review for these for a while.	1	1
I returned my GT Cut 2s, imo they are so much worse the the 1s. Had heel slippage, heel traction felt nonexistent, and toes definitely kept getting jammed up. Best part of the 2s is the smear traction.	0	0
Haha heck yeah, was literally thinking today, this exact video would be great right about now 😂👌	2	2
I think the GT cut 2’s look better imo	2	2
I really liked this review, complete and straight to the point! Great job!	2	2
just my opinion, the traction missing out in the mid section, so if you plant like what he did 2:00, you WOULD slideeeeee	1	1
Great extensive review. Think I would stick with the 1's	2	2
Excellent work on this! Can you please do performance review on the freak 4? 😃	2	2
"PLEASE tell me Allen is a Community fan. That scene with Donald Glover/Troy Barnes is so good!

I will definitely give these a chance👍"	2	2
great review Allen	2	2
I actually had a ton of traction issues with the 2. I had to return them  because I felt that the traction was pretty trash. I only played with them indoors, and I felt that the traction design and overall foot feel was too diff from the beloved Gt cut1s	2	2
Lockdown is terrible with this shoe. My left shoe came off during play even though I had them tied so tight I lost feeling in that same foot. If you’re considering these just buy the Lebron 20’s instead.	0	0
Keep it up, appreciate the reviews 👍	1	2
Another solid review!	1	2
What about sizing? True to size is it ok?	2	2
is it normalnthat even tho i added 1+ size in the shoe my foot is literally touching the tip of the shoe	2	2
Hi Allen, is that outdoor court in La Palma Ca?  Looks familiar to me.  Great review	2	2
I liked the 2s wish they had some better colorways tho I like my green pair the best but those PKI black and gold 🔥	2	2
Awesome review Allen! Love these shoes	2	2
Really prefer the GT Cut 1 look, but will try to get a pair of the 2s!	2	2
I sprained my ankle in the first time playing in these 😢 but i still love them	2	2
i had to go up half a size. The traction is fantastic. There's a bit of heel slippage whether I wore my size or sized up. That was fixed by using a runner's lace lock technique. Then I blew out my calf.	2	2
They feel tight even tho I got the right size is that normal I barley got em	1	1
I feel like the tongue rings dig into my feet on my pair and it lowkey hurts. Also the heel slippage is pretty bad on these even when tied super tight with a runners not. I would pick a shoe like the lebron 20/nxxt over these any day of the week	0	1
The get cut 2’s are comfy but I get really bad blisters from them	0	0
Man I recognize that court and I may have played in there before. SUPER dusty. I also have a pair of the GT Cut 2 and it grips great at that court.	2	2
I slipped a lot while I was doing crossover.This shoe's traction is bad at spinning or sideways even if it's in indoor hardwood courts.	0	0
Are those gt cut 1,2,3 low or mid shoes?	1	1
"Mmm weight distribution? Balanced? Mm idk I would say it’s bottom heavy just by trying them on and simply looking at em. Won’t be much of a difference on court tho. Hopefully I can get some at clearance.

And rocking ankle braces all the time at your age? Hopefully not too much. Gotta allow your ankles to strengthen.. if anything I only wear them during highly competitive Rec league games. Otherwise don’t do it kids."	1	1
I really like the 2 but somehow my left insole feels like a bubble in the forefoot like it would pop any secone if I put more strength into it. Anyone has the problem too?	2	2
Would you be willing to do a review on those Zamst ankle braces?	1	2
How was the sizing?	1	1
Most mid shoe I have ever put on walked around in them for 5 mins and returned them	2	2
Cut 2 looks like the epic reacts	1	1
Best low tops of 2022 vid?	2	2
I just poked through the heel zoom, so I could be more contained inside the shoe.	1	1
I have the Devin Booker PE version	1	1
Ayo how bout that Brea community center court though haha wtf. That’s my OG court	1	2
why do these low-key look like NB fresh foam Cruz	2	2
What is GT stands for?	1	1
Oof, history suggests this model goes downhill. Hyperfuse 1 was amazing, all other hyperfuse models were not comparatively same with the bb1 to the bb2	1	2
What are you talking about bro? Its even more bottom heavy then the first one...	0	0
I still need to know what that song is mannnnnn	1	1
For these I would most likely double sock	2	2
Allen Iverson brother	1	1
I thought Chris (Nightwing2303) himself used to do the reviews? What's happened to the channel?	1	1
2 words. Heel slippage!!! Absolutely unacceptable!!!	2	2
lmao i hate that lemon gym my rs dreamers cant grip on it	0	0
That shoe is trash. I could not put that ugly ass thing on my foot for $160. How did they go from the first one to that???	0	0
play safe much	2	2
Wait...who tf is that guy?	1	1
"Nice review!  And agree!  Picked it up and use it with an X stand so it's more ""portable"".  I lug it to the back patio and practice so the dog can play outside.  I usually play a Steinway CG and I was stunned at how this little keyboard feels under my fingers. It sounds beautiful!  Our dog is happy too."	2	2
My P225 just arrived today, and the speakers and the keys' soft yet authentic touch are fabulous!	2	1
Excellent review. VRM technology was the game changer for me. I had a Yamaha P-60 that I just sold and now I own a P-225. Couldn't be happier with the sound and playability.	2	2
Wonderful simple and honest review that helped secure a decision. Thank you.	1	2
I’m excited to test this piano	2	1
My piano arrives next week, I feel hoppy, happy and excited ??	2	1
Getting it delivered tomorrow. In white!!! So excited ??	2	1
For those concerned about speakers , believe , p225 sounds terrific, fp10 and pxs 1100 are like toys compared to p225 speakers. Iam not talking  about tone and quality of signal sounds each one has its qualities, but the speakers hands down. I tryed them yesterday	2	1
Why does the P125 have a different E. piano on the website? Do those voices also exist in the P225 model?	1	1
You're the first reviewer to talk about the sound vents I saw..... as a P125 owner, I found those front speakers to be a turn off for me vs P125 speaker placement as a hobbyist player...... could be a game changer for an eventual upgrade...to get the GFX sound engine....	2	2
This instrument really sounds nice.  I wonder if it is a better choice than the DGX-670 which is a complicated beast.	2	1
Just bought one today!	1	1
"Loved your Debussy!
Thanks for the great review"	1	2
"Great review of the 225. I've had a P-80 for years and love it. Headphones only, but sounds great with those. I just got a P-45, did not like the sound. It's not ""bad"" but sounds muddy in the lower register with chords, seems OK with single notes. That might be due to the lower polyphony.  I sent the P-45 back and will be ordering a P-225 which I think will be miles better sound wise.  BTW the key bed on the P-45 was fine, just the sound was not. Again it was not ""bad"" and probably fine for beginners."	1	2
Does it have 2-way audio where you can access sample libraries and play different sounds from them on the keyboard?	1	1
"This is not the first ""p series"" with resonance modeling. It's been in the p515 for years. P515 also has the CFX sound. P515 is much more expensive, though."	1	1
"I might have considered this due to the form factor, but I bought a Casio Privia in March and feel happy with how incredible it is for the price. 

I expect this will be a cosy success."	1	1
How many acoustic piano variations does it has?	1	1
Why move the speaker to the back, as if there's no room at the top? I remember disassembling my Clavinova years ago. It was very empty, yet they put the speakers at the bottom!	0	1
haa... i guess on 7:42 he suppressed laughing as he seems having realized this white thing hanging on his Headphones ??	1	1
It looks and sounds stunning. Question: Can you 'layer' two sounds together eg; E-Piano and Vibraphone?	1	1
Do you have to have the console stand to use the pedals? Or could I just purchase an X stand and use the pedals with it that way?	1	1
First time buyer; I'm really  impressed. Can the P225 be plugged into an external amplifier, and if so, how? Thanx for any reply. JP	2	1
Do the rear facing speakers work ok when placed against a wall?	1	1
Does it have the same feature as the YDP 145 and only changes the structure?	1	1
"New to piano / advice … I’m
Seeking an e-piano but I don’t want/ need all the other sound samples/ fix et etc… just quality piano sound plus possibly ability add strings, and possibly reverb … thoughts appreciated if you know of something like this or you stock…?"	1	1
is a USB cable included or do I have to buy it	1	1
The speaker placement reminds me of the P-255	1	1
I heard P125 had some issues on midi velocity when it works as midi controller. Can you check how the velocity reaction is like on this model? Also, can you recommend any digital piano with a great velocity for delicate piano playing? Thank you so much!	1	1
Does it have fully weighted keys?	1	1
@7:45 lol. The look of shame ????	1	1
Pedal LP-1 or FC35 is better?	1	1
does it have bluetooth midi?	1	1
How much $ is it compared to the p125 and p515?	1	1
I'm a learner,  what is intermediate level, what's the next to it?	1	1
what would you recommend ? this one or the kawai es120 ?	1	1
Is it possible to tune this down a half step?	1	1
Do you guys think the dgx 670 is better	1	1
Have one, before you buy, carefully check  higher notes sound ( which are little bit annoying for all piano modes). I used to have older Yamaha, where it was more natural. I would not buy it again.	0	1
Can you combine tones such as Organ & Electric Piano? Piano & Strings? Are there any flutes, or harps? Is there more than 1 electric piano sounds? Is there an Oboe?	1	1
Speaker redesign mimics Casio PXS Series!	1	1
Can you record onto a USB stick ??	1	1
How many actual piano sounds does it have ?	1	1
"Please more information about speakers, how much amplifiers watt, how many speakers, more information Please.
Long time awaiting for P515 Upgrading, already 5 years and still shining. 
Yes this is beautiful P-225 touch !. Thank you ."	2	2
Hi, whats your thoughts on upgrading from the P-125, is it worth it?	1	1
I bought one, but I found the volume extremely low, can anyone tell me if there is a setting for this?	1	1
Does the p-225 has built in audio interface?	1	1
distance to the wall during home use?	1	1
What is the difference between the P-125 b model and the P-225? which one do you recommend?	1	1
if the key action is similar to Casio PX-S7000, then it won't work for me. When my thumb and little fingers are on the black keys, and now my middle or ring finger needs to press on the black key softly, because it is so close to the felt area, I wasn't able to press down on the Casio PX-S7000 black keys	1	1
Please p221 (61 or 73 keys, battery powered version,) thank you??	1	1
wow how do you get it so fast!!	1	2
If anyone has a p125 I'll trade my brand new p225 for it, I just like the layout of 125 better	0	1
I really wish they had put the same effort and upgrade to the P525 (their FLAGSHIP model) which is terrible!	1	1
Is this compatible with the Samsung Galaxy (Android) tablets?	1	1
Same old, Yamaha keeps releasing 20 year old technology, 20 sounds, no midi, no pitch.	0	1
"""A completely redesigned action to fit in a slimmer chassis"": which is not a good thing at all. In fact, it is very bad."	0	1
I just ordered the 100W Ugreen charger and was looking for a video that would recommend a better one until I saw the number one in your video. I guess I made the right choice.	2	2
Nice vid Thx	2	2
Big fan of your videos. Keep up the good work! <3	2	2
"Thank you for the fantastic review!
I was looking at the ugreen charger, and of course a bunch of adds for other powerbanks from their companu started to pop up... Any thought on the UGREEN Nexode Power Bank 25000mAh 200W?"	2	2
Where do you shop for groceries?  I wish I could spend under $250 a week on groceries.  😉	1	1
"Like it feels good in my hand 

Maybe don’t do that next time 😂"	2	2
Anker powerbank is awesome i have the previous model of the prime and it's been one of the best purchases I've done	2	2
Definitely fast coverage of info.	1	2
5:04 It only gets 100 watts with the optional base charging unit, otherwise you can only manage 65 watts, which is still fast.  Downside, this pack won't charge any other powerbank like the Nano through USB C.	1	1
Is it power delivery?	1	1
This is an amazing no-nonsense review, thank you so much! You just earned a new subscriber	2	2
Thanks Bro	2	2
Cool batteries and all but nice bicep vein 😂😂😂😂	2	2
Don't need a jackery, there are several power banks above 20k mah I have a few to power my laptop	1	1
Is this me or ugreen winning in every category of products. I have nothing against ugreen but i know for a fact that they pay youtubers good money despite what they say.	2	2
The price and performance of that 20,000 Iniu puts it at #1 for most folk  ;)	2	2
Just did my purchase according to these reviews!!!! Doesn't matter which one but it helped a lot!!! Thanks mate...	1	1
No shargeek chargers making top 5?	2	2
Such great information. Could explain how you get the temperature numbers for these items? I mean, 61ºF is the hottest you recorded. Is that above ambient? Again, terrific review as always.	1	1
Did you notice the Anker GanPrime was sturdy when plugged into the outlet given that it's only a 2 prong not a 3?	1	1
I've got a INIU 10000mAh 22w and love it.  It also has a light if needed :) Best £20 i spent.	2	2
better to make a weight table and also other table with characteristics. would be useful to compare. i personally have iniu 10k powerbank, it charges slowly but i use it daily, so no problem, the smallest and lightest and cheapest. and i have an old 20k baseus powerbank that charges really quick! i like to pick it to hiking trips. my recommendations	1	1
You can tell who sponsored his video with the opening comment... Anchor	1	1
"My powerbank it’s wayyyy better and cheaper than all these batteries combined.
“Koosed” 1
USB A and 2 type C (100w in/out max 145w out ) 27.000 mah and it only cost me 55€ plus a 100 W charger with 2 usb c and type A for 24€"	2	2
Lean, hard and fast info, not some 45 min blah blah blah video. THANK YOU	1	1
This review, while meant well, didn’t actually test anything.  And it would have been soooooo easy	2	2
One of your funniest videos ever. Im impressed at how many references you use. Very clever	2	2
"The Ugreen 100W powerbank is fantastic indeed, and performs incredibly well, though i agree that its really slippery, so i usually keep it inside its little bag.

I am using it to charge my Vivo X100, because it is one of the few that supports PPS charging up to 20V and 5A that the X100 is able to accept."	1	1
Holding up a product for display please do not place it in front of Monty, that’s just plain rude	1	0
do you mind reviewing some usb-c magnetic adapters? please T_T	1	1
"Can U do a magnetic power charger 4📱? I just hate connecting wire 2 charger up my 📱. Thank U 4 the 🕙. N Thank U 4 showing. 👍

"I am one of those people who thinks ""I should get one"".  And, then, I realise that I cannot come up with a good reason."	2	2
I don't understand why Anker prime 20k is second, but you didn't envolved anker 737 which i use regularly and is a 24k plus the pros of the prime, charging it at 100W with 140W total output, c1 100W, and same screen 🤔 could you do a video on your opinion about all the anker powerbanks?	1	1
Excellent video except the sexual dirty remarks made, quite unnecessary.	1	1
That dog is SO stinking cute!	1	2
Thanks for the review...appreciate the capacity test numbers to verify you get what's being advertised.  I'm seeing a lot of Anker Prime knockoffs on Amazon with $60-80 pricing and thinking they can't have the actual mAH capacity they are touting.  Lastly, could you start adding a mention if each power bank supports pass-through charging as well.  This is one reason I chose the Anker Prime, that I can run a USB-C device (like the new Starlink Mini) WHILE also charging/maintaining the Anker Prime power bank with my foldable 45w solar panel.	1	1
5:18 Even the dog wants you to STOP!	2	2
I just purchased one, battery is 0, I'm charging for 4 hours and continues 0	1	1
"Wow no.3 is priced at what... $70 ?! 🤔
Totally shocked as it was sold for $14 in China last month in a flash sale. Absolutely loved it! Great review as always mate, cheers!"	2	2
I use the Anker 27,650 power bank for my Meta Quest 3..... is much bigger than the 20k you have on there... cheers!	2	2
Have you tried out the omnicharge 20C+? If so, how does it compare to the rest of the power banks?	1	1
I need a power bank to recharge my brain. All these camera switches were exhausting!	0	0
you need to test PB1165mi, one porblem it has it does not have USB A out	1	1
Is Monty a real dog? Dogs aside one thing that cannot be tested with a review is reliability and when established players have a good reputation it is hard to go past them if you don't want to take a chance.	1	1
What are you doing to that power bank bro 😭😭😭	1	1
Are used to enjoy your videos whoever I don’t like them anymore. The way you edit them with them being so fast in the sense of to a new picture talking very fast just the editing of the whole videos is crap now it’s kinda actually nauseating watching it for me, I can understand why you do it. It’s because you’re trying to keep the attention of the younger generation because they have such a short attention span. I don’t like it. I don’t watch your videos anymore because of it your ostracizing the group in my opinion cheers.	1	0
"1:21 it’s common knowledge 101 that always keeping a battery at 100% is a bad thing!

The fact that this is my first introduction to your channel and you didn’t know that doesn’t bode well for you"	0	0
I like Anker but too many cables of theirs have filed on me. But their other stuff has been solid.	1	1
Is this better than a powerbank 😲🤪	2	2
5:18 your welcome 😂	2	2
Would like to have your thoughts and opinions on the Nitecore battery packs. Thanks!	2	2
Please make make a 25k mah video for the best airplane carry on!	2	2
Best one is anker prime 27650 that powerbank is a beasttttt	2	2
How is Anker akways at the top despite being so dogshit? 😂	2	2
Great video. Well paced and cut. 🍻	2	2
Can any of these power bank charge up my JBL charge 5 Bluetooth speaker?	1	1
Too quick. Couldn’t take note of anything. Almost useless for non-English natives.	1	0
You Are The Best! 🎉 Legit 💯	2	2
You're definetely mixing fahrenheit with celcius? 60F would be cold to the touch. Anyways, really good video. Thank you!	2	2
thank u kind sir	2	2
Thank you :)	2	2
Unfortunately the jack all trades powerbank is not efficient. I do not recommend it at all.  Better to carry a powerbank and an adapter for better overall performance	1	1
your dog can do what most humans cant do.	1	2
Which one to buy just to charge my phone and bring it everywhere with me?	1	1
Excellent review @MobileReviewsEh!, I saw this one, Yoocas Portable Power Bank, 2 in1 Hybrid Charger-10000mAh, and looks like the first Anker with a nicer screen, but wonder how well will do with your tests?, is cheaper and seems to offer exactly the same as the Anker.	2	2
fake reviews. You only able to know its fake or not to open up the powerbank most om them are fake. They declaring 2000 but the battery itself ist mostly 1000mah.	0	0
Anker 733 I have and the Anker 165w 25k	2	2
Try Beaeus Adaman 2 VOOC 30w Power bank.. its the size of anker 10kmah mini power bank	1	1
Either one you get, we have the wall with us everywhere we go. Coolest gadget to have😎	1	1
This video is worth a subscribe ❤	2	2
"""Heat"" was one of the criteria in your evaluations.
Is there a link or posted measurements on each battery bank tested?"	1	1
why is no one talking about the Powerbank Graphene Pro UltiMag??	1	1
5:19  😂 let me subscribe you with feel good in that hand	2	2
I am suprised  anker 737 didnt make the list	1	1
Can you please make a video for best solar powered bank charger too	1	2
Remember, fast charging = shorter lifespan. Every reference I read states that to maximize the life of your battery, keep the power level between 20% and 90%. Try not to go under and do not charge to 100% if you want max battery output life. And...99% of all power bank makers state the capacity of their PBs to be lets say 20,000mAh. The actual output will be between 10% and 20% less than the 20,000mAh stated, with 20% less output being the norm. Batteries that output of 90% and above simply UNDERSTATE the actual capacity so it appears they have more efficient batteries. A 20,000mAh may have 22,000mAh actual capacity, so it may appear that it is 90% efficient. More capacity = more weight, unless they fudged the numbers. Also, check for pass-through charging. Many makers do not build that capability into their PBs to cut manufacturing costs. Pass-through charging means you can charge the PB and device(s) connected to the PB simultaneously.	1	1
Love anker.  Its so reliable and holds full charge even after 6 months.	2	2
Have you thought about adding UK affiliate links?  I've spent a couple of £100 thanks to you.	1	1
Got a new subscriber here! Appreciate this approach!	2	2
Updated MagSafe charger ?	1	1
I am so happy that this channel took off, I been watching your videos since 10k subs and always come back to see videos of the products I am interested in. Glad to see you blew up since then. Although I do miss the fact that you no longer heart every comment or leave a reply to them as much anymore but I understand why, it becomes difficult when your channel grows.	2	2
why not UGREEN 145W 25,000mAh?	1	1
What about the Shargeek 140? Its the best in my opinion.	2	2
No capacity test. Skipped	1	1
Love you channel but 5:18 was uncalled for	2	2
when you say dollar, do you mean American or Canadian?	1	1
I love the two in 1 but the plug comes out of every wall I put it in. Would be perfect if it had a additional plug with a wire.	2	2
How do you get a dog to sit still like that? Is it CGI?	1	1
I think I would rather put my money on Anker for longevity & safety, who knows where Ugreen is assembled let alone the durability.	1	1
Anyway you can do a solar powered version of these please	1	1
Quite an amateur review. Waste of time. The guy obviously has no idea about efficiency and voltage difference, let alone total power consumption.	0	0
"Basically what i need is :

1. Fast charging power bank (not too extreme like 100+ watts, but at least 25 watts)
2. Pass through charging (you can charge the power bank itself from the wall socket but simultaneously charging your phone too)"	1	1
The dog is waiting for you to hurry up because he's hungry 😅	1	1
All the shhh sounds in his words are killing the video man scrub audio before publishing so people don’t get lost in all the shhhh couldn’t you make while speaking.	1	1
Quick question, is Anker better than ugreen? Considering the Anker 737 or the Ugreen nexode 200W power bank	2	2
I love your style and honesty. For that, you have a new subscriber. God bless you 🙏🏾	2	2
Loved your video especially your dog’s sense of humour and smart attire!!	2	2
18,000 miles on my '22 Mach-e.  No issues so far.	2	2
Its not a Mustang, never will be why they have to mess up all the muscle cars up is beyond me	0	0
the Mach E is the best EV overall of all EVs currently under $50k..& best thing about it: Musk rat is not in your life	2	2
The Hyundai Kona doesn’t have a fake trunk and I’m pretty pissed about it the whole wanna be engine component thing	1	1
ouch 45 mins that would suck on a road trip	1	1
....and now the Mach-E can charge at Tesla chargers.  So much for the Mach-E's problem #1.	2	2
As a Ford owner I really want to like the Mustang Mach-E. As a first effort (ignoring the Focus Electric) it has a lot going for it but not quite enough for me to buy one. The two biggest issues for me are: 1) how quickly the price escalates when you opt for the bigger battery, AWD and upgrade trim level and 2) its efficiency. The 37kWh/100 mile puts it pretty far back in the pack of current EVs. EV buyers should prioritize this at least as much as range as this is a measure of how much it will cost to drive. I'm confident Ford's next effort will be more competitive but if I end up shopping for an EV before that happens I'll be looking elsewhere.	0	0
You forgot to mention the additional dealer markup to the Mach-E, which makes it even more expensive.	1	1
Not sure where he got his numbers from, but I had a MY and it never charged 0-80% in 15 minutes. Hell, it’s slower than the EV6 and even that car only touts 20-80 in 18 minutes	0	0
45 minutes isnt bad! Thats lunch	0	0
Thinking to get a Mach e or model y after My Ioniq5 had an ICCU recall. They updated the software twice h then the ICCU finally failed and left my ass stranded the other day. Now it's gonna take them over a month to fix they don't even know actually TBA didn't even give me a comparable loaner. Other people are saying their io5 still has  iccu problem after. Can't decide i just want a reliable EV car that won't break down darn it!!	0	0
I like the body style and the look of it. Can you get it in a gas model or a hybrid? Electric cars or throwaway cars when a cell goes bad you’re done.	0	0
He's the truth... How about running a MustingE head to head with ANY Gas Mustang from NYC to LA and see who get's there first and how far behind the MUSTANG E is when ANY Gas Mustang gets to LA.	1	1
Guys I just test drove a mustang suv today. He wasn’t lying about the 0-60 comment!	2	2
"The Mustang Mach-e is one of those ""Almost There"" products.  Its looks and fit/finish are top of class, but the lack of a heat pump and its ""Mid"" DCFC speeds keeps me and many others from buying it.  Drove over 1000 miles in one, and came away very impressed."	2	2
I am driving a Mach-E at my work. It is like driving a magic carpet. I did not think I would like an electric car. But after driving the Mach-E. I want my own sooooo bad.	2	2
This whole thing is a con no pros about it...its not even a real mustang..its a glorified battery operated mini SUV and did a marketing hack job by gluing a plastic horse on a car..	0	0
I would rather drive a mustang than a swasticar or wankpanzer.	1	1
My Model Y did not charge 0-80% in 16 minutes.	1	1

20,000 sold in 9 months is fucking embarrassing. It isnt even a new ev	0	0
When “Mach” is pronounced “Mack” instead of “Mock”, people can’t stop thinking about “Mustang Mac and Cheese”.	1	1
Sadly, it failed my expectations after this great video.	0	2
It is a looker...an ugly looker...lol	0	0
I love this car so much. I look at it every single time I see it parked. I really love it!	2	2
Love your energy and the to the point delivery.  Question  Why does it look like a suv, but it's being compared to a car? Is it the style of the Mach E? Thanks, living in MI makes this a  no-go winter, which is always a factor to consider with electric cars.	2	2
i was going to buy one but probably not anymore thanks Alex	2	2
That was a fair comparison, with no Tesla hate. Kudos.	1	1
Great short report one more con no towing allowed for US version vs Y 3500#	2	2
Like these comparisons. Still shopping around to see what makes sense for our wallet. Do you know if the Mach E will be revising their battery type in the coming years?	1	1
I was going to buy a Model Y until Elon got so psycho. My Mach-E is fantastic! No regrets. And I'm glad not one nickel of my money is going to Lone Skum.	2	2
Can I go w/o charging at my house alone?	1	1
As long as Ford Mach E got 7500 Tax Credit. Seem Ford don't care about it.	1	1
Ford missed there mark. Just put a 69 body on a frame. Would have sold more.	0	2
Don’t forget the extra 1 second. It’s not 5.	1	1
The Mach E it’s a looker only when u see it once or twice. More you see it more it gets overly lined and doesn’t hold design in my eyes. That’s why European makers stay away from those over curved lines	1	1
You can put a Machine Gun Nest in the fronk. Just saying.	1	1
Honestly who needs these headaches in one’s life	0	0
Ford states 96hrs to Charge.	1	1
if they made an eco boost hybrid model it would probably be hot	2	2
"Very nice car...still like my Ioniq5 AWD Ultimate better! Drove several Mach E's before buying the I5, no regrets at all! Ford I think has done well with it and wish them great success in the future!

Good luck if your software update fails and your car refuses to start.  Passing on this garbage excuse of a vehicle.	0	0
I'm thinking of trading in my Camaro for this car...	2	2
Had mine for 3 months and IN LOVE! Great car and quality.	2	2
I can tell you one of the biggest Con on this car is it's ugly as hell why couldn't Ford make a decent looking car not like a pinto or something other than that hideous thing that they put on the market	0	0
I have a select and I charge 30% to 80% in 20 minutes.  Most people don't run there cars under that.	2	2
I don’t know what Ford was thinking when they decided to name this thing after “Mustang”! In no way does it have the sporty look of historical Mustangs and it’s ugly as hell from the front. Nothing about its looks says buy me.	0	0
Speak in km/h please	1	1
The frunk on the Mach E isnt that big, esp compared to frunks on other evs. I really like this car, but idk if I like it enough to spend $40K on it. It is a mustang tho. I wonder if Ford added the brand name for the $$$$ it can bring in	1	1
Imagine owning the ugliest mustang to date	0	0
The biggest con is that is not a Mustang. Biggest Pro is that the station wagon is alive and well but Ford wants to make on SUV for the cool soccer mom😂	2	2
You forgot a BIG Con. You can only get max power for about 5 seconds and then there’s a huge drop	0	0
Ok.... I forgive you.  The format change was a good idea.  A different voice with a different message was needed.	2	2
A very balanced review and comparison.	2	2
"There are no pros. If you buy one, it's because you are a poser. I hate EVs, but even I know that teslas are a smarter buy if you must have an EV. The ford is slower, heavier, and somehow uglier to look at, plus the fact that they slapped a pony logo on an SUV is just depressing. There are no pros to having a mach-e, only laughs and head shakes from car enthusiasts, sad and/or angry glances from ford fans, and open mockery from pretty much everyone who sees how thirsty you are. 

Facts."	0	0
They should have just removed the name Mustang from it and just call it Ford Mach E, everyone would be happy	2	2
They should called it the ford donkey or the electric burro. Doesn’t look like a mustang. The pintostangs have more mustang blood in them than this.	0	0
Hey, all I want to see is a rugged road test with the Mach E participating with other EVs.  This includes the Bolt!	1	1
I could do a Tesla but I don’t like the Nazi saluting wannabe oligarch that comes with those.	1	1
I owned a 21 Premium Mach-E for 18 months.  It was the most fun car to drive that I have ever owned.  The down side for me was that we travel a bunch and the charging time needed for our trips was a pain.  Traded the Mach-E for a PHEV and it is nice to not have to worry about charging when we travel while still being mostly electric for our normal weekly routine.	2	2
Why can’t Tesla make a decent looking vehicle? This is where Mach E blows Tesla out of the water! Problem is I’m not paying 75k for looks. Mustang has much work to do in the performance / price arena. $ 75k for a Ford? Uh no.	2	2
I just bought a brand new 2024 MachE GT with the performance upgrade and bronze package at a price of $56,000 ($59k after tax and registration). I also got 0% interest for 72 months as well as a Ford home pro charger and free home installation (which is around another $3000 give or take) that was free.  Zero regrets whatsoever, already put 700 miles on it.  It’s the funnest car I’ve ever driven, to include the fully loaded model y that my buddy let me take care of for two weeks while he left town.  Don’t get me wrong, the Tesla was fun to drive, but the Mach e interior is more comfortable and it has a certain look to it that stands out from the typical Tesla crowd.  As an added bonus, I don’t have to worry about some psychos out there keying my car 🤷🏻‍♂️	2	2
Waiting for 500 mile range and fast changing 10-15 minutes.. Hybrid cars for me for now otherwise.	2	2
If you don’t get the GT or Rally version, you are only getting rear wheel drive.  No good for anyone who has to drive in snow and icy conditions.	0	0
2:00 charging 10 to 80% in the 2024 Mach e takes 32 minutes, not 45 minutes.	1	1
"I have to say, EVs are biggest con in the last hundred years .
 For a start , just imagine for a second buyers having to pay extra on top of the already inflated price of an EV to get extra range YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE !
  Seriously, what a con !
 EVs are electricity guzzlers, it’s a  proven fact, when you load up an EV compared to an equivalent ICE vehicle, the EV will run out of power much faster. 
 Add to that , the minute  you take possession of your EV and start using it gradually that hugely expensive battery pack is going to degrade , and your range and then a massive chunk out of your bank account to replace that expended battery with out any doubt after the warranty runs out. 
 If you want a good abbreviation for the word scam  , it is EV !"	0	0
Ford has a long way to go.  I agree 100% if you don’t have a home charger then don’t bother.	0	0
I'm very interested in buying one and along with getting the best value for my money I have zero desire to give Musk any of my dollars. I'm content to wait for other companies that treat their workers better close the gap. Musk's actions are a MAJOR turn off!  I will continue to gather more information before making my purchase.	2	2
Know that number on the Tesla charger is not correct it takes at least 20 minutes to go from 20 to 80	0	0
"Ford should NEVER have named that Lincoln Navigator sized turd a Mustang. They should have called it a ""Farley""."	1	1
I did not watch the video. However, just take some glue and put a couple mustangs on a car does not make it a Mustang. It does not even look like a Mustang and it is electric. Enough said? No, since when does a Mustang have 4 doors?	1	1
The Mach E has familiar stalks and the Ford dealership to support you when there is any trouble.  Once they use the NACS (Tesla) superchargers as standard, the car rental companies would be more welcoming to this car.	2	2
Very ugly looking car. Shame they used the mustang name	0	0
Most people wouldn't drive more than 300 Miles in one day, so the 45 min charge becomes less relevant imo, because you recharge it overnight. For those who do, sure, it'll take longer, but not as much as you might think by the time you factor in food stops and toilet breaks, plus; you may not need to charge to 100% to get to your destination for that overnight charge. This is my experience as a Tesla 3 driver. Currently my first 200 Miles is free from home solar, but the extra 100 Miles sure is very tempting..	2	2
The Mach E GT performance can do 0 to 60 in 3.3 seconds just like the Model 3, but the range is less about 280 miles. I heard that the Mach E is more comfortable and quieter, also I like that the Mach E has the speedometer right in front of the driver seat like every car other than a Tesla, so after watching many comparison videos I placed an order for a 2025 Mach E GT performance.	2	2
the fast charging now to 80% is 30-35 minutes	2	2
You forgot to add that in 2024 the Ford Mustang Mach E will be able to charge at the Tesla level 3 chargers nationwide, lowering the charge time.	2	2
I bought a Mach e. Two and a half years ago.  I have the extended range battery. BUT your numbers are wrong. It was 76,000 dollars. First, it’s a great car and I love it. It is extremely comfortable to sit in. It has all the features anyone could want. That said, charging at home is an overnight affair. I won’t use fast chargers because the charge you by TIME that you are hooked up. That makes it more expensive than gas. While the “frunk” is nice, I never use it. And that area remains unseated during snow. So snow builds up while you drive.  Using the one pedal drive causes your rotors to rust up from not being used. Then you switch back to normal drive and the pads and rust combine to destroy your rotors. I could go on and on about the poor features. But there’s no time here. So while I liked your presentation, you don’t have all the facts. You should dig deeper. I’ll end with this. EVs are not what they are cranked up to be. Before you buy one, DO YOUR HOMEWORK. LET THE BUYER BEWARE. Dealers won’t tell you the down sides. Politicians are pursuing an agenda. They LIE. Our nations electric grid cannot handle the load. Californians are already being told NOT to charge up at home. EVs are not ready for Prime Time. They only can last about 10 years, MAX. THEN YOU NEED TO REPLACE THE BATTERY. That costs, in my case, $37,000. A gas car can last 20 years or more with proper care. Not so for EVs. If people don’t buy them, manufacturers won’t make them. EVs are being pushed down our throats by lying, scheming politicians. That includes our “Resident.”	2	2
Evs are a fad, just like they were 20, 30, 40, and even 50 years ago. They are nothing new and will not last as gas cars can last longer and drive longer distances. While they are good in theory, evs are more dangerous to the environment with lithium batteries . Which are more dangerous to the environment than gas and costs 3x as much to produce.  So you're not saving the environment, you're actually killing it x3.	1	1
Yeah, in the top three requirements of my next BEV is a fast charge rate and flat curve.	2	2
I don't get why this is labeled as a mustang when its a 4 door crossover but it seems to be a decent EV. They should make one thats a 2 door coupe or convertible like mustangs have always been previously.	1	1
Amazing looking car, had mine for 6 months nothing but amazing. People regularly compliment the looks.  I drove so many electric cars and i bought this one as soon as i sat in it. So many people seem to comment without actually owning or driving one.	2	2
Bought my wife a Mach E GT and love it. When we travel long distances we use a gas vehicle but we hardly ever do. Had it for about 4 months and it drives and charges seamlessly.	2	2
A big “pro” is that there are thousands of low mileage used ones for sale for under $30,000.  NEVER buy a new EV because they depreciate so rapidly.	1	1
THANK YOU!	1	1
I already have one n I love it more than any Tesla out there	2	2
"I'm a big fan of ford products. I currently own a '52 F3 flat bed truck w/flat head V8. a '65 Mustang 289 cinvertible,  a '67 F-100 352 short bed, a '70 Torino 351 convertible, an '04 Thunderbird convertible, a '17  Expedition, and a '22 Escape. I am among the many who dislike the direction Ford went with the Mach-E. As a Ford fan I amd disappointed with the overall quality of their EV's - especially their low charging rates and vehicle software integration. Worse, I detest the poor economics of Ford's EV manufacturing decisions which are bleeding the company dry economically. (They can't sell them for what it costs to make them!)

After waiting and waiting to purchase a new Ford as my first EV, I wound up buying a Tesla Model S (with which I am thoroughly satisfied.) C'mon Ford, get your EV act together!"	0	0
Using the name Mustang for this overweight SUV/Crossover is still a travesty....	0	0
Honestly the zero to 60 nobody cares. It's not like I'm the red light... Ready set go!	2	2
This thing is a slap in the face to the Mustang. Which Is a powerful muscle car. Guaranteed 300 to 400 miles per tank and $40 to fill up in 5 minutes.	0	0
"Mustang= sports car, family limo or station wagon= family car.
Any questions children?"	1	1
People wich one its better ? Tesla or that one ?	1	2
I love my Mach e GT Perf!  Best car I have ever driven, and at 74 I have driven a lot of high end cars.	2	2
Love those pros and cons in 5 videos Alex.  Keep them coming!	2	2
